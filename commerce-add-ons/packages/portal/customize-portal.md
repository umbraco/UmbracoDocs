# Customize Portal

The Portal is designed with flexibility in mind, offering multiple customization options to ensure it fits seamlessly with your specific Commerce workflow.

The portal includes customizable pages (such as login, registration, and account management) that can be aligned with your brand.

## Setup

To allow customization you must first 'override' the existing files for the step required to be modified. 

To do this follow these steps:

1. Copy the equivalent [files and partials](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.Commerce.Portal/tree/main/src/Umbraco.Commerce.Portal/Views/UmbracoCommercePortal). 
2. Add them to `Views/UmbracoCommercePortal` in your project directory. It might be necessary to create the folder first.
3. Make a small text change to one of the Views to verify that the files are in use.
4. Verify that the changes are carried out and displayed correctly.

You are now ready to start customizing the Portal page to fit the design of your website.
