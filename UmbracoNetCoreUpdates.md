## Umbraco 9 (.NET 5) Release Candidate

:::warning
As this is a **release candidate**, bugs and minor issues are to be expected.

Found a bug that isn't already reported? Please report it on the [GitHub tracker](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco-CMS/issues/new?assignees=&labels=type%2Fbug&template=01_bug_report.yml).
:::

To get started, follow the steps outlined below.

### Prerequisites

* [.NET 5 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
* SQL connection string (MS SQL Server/Azure), unless you want to install using SQL CE (Compact Edition)

### Steps to install the Umbraco `dotnet new` template

1. Install the new Umbraco dotnet template:

    ```none
    dotnet new -i Umbraco.Templates::9.0.0-rc004
    ```

### [Optional] Update the template from earlier pre-release versions

If you have already installed the Umbraco `dotnet new` template, you will need ensure it is up-to-date

1. Use a command prompt of your choice to update the `dotnet new` templates

    ```none
    dotnet new -i Umbraco.Templates::9.0.0-rc004
    ```

### Steps to create an Umbraco Project using the `dotnet new` template

1. Create a new empty Umbraco project using MS SQL Azure/Server:

    ```none
    dotnet new umbraco -n MyCustomUmbracoProject
    ```

    Or if you prefer to using SQL CE:

    ```none
    dotnet new umbraco --SqlCe -n MyCustomUmbracoProject
    ```

You will now have a new project with the name `MyCustomUmbracoProject`, or whichever name you chose.

The new project can be opened and run using your favorite IDE or you can continue to use the CLI commands.

### Steps to build and run

The following steps, will continue using CLI based on the steps above.

1. Navigate to the newly created project folder:

    ```none
    cd MyCustomUmbracoProject
    ```

2. Build and run the new Umbraco .Net Core project:

    ```none
    dotnet build
    dotnet run
    ```

The project is now running on the [Kestrel server](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/servers/?view=aspnetcore-5.0&tabs=windows#kestrel) and is available on the ports listed in the console.

The next step is to run through the Umbraco CMS installation. If you chose to use MS SQL Server/Azure you will need to add your connection string during this setup process.

Once the installation process is complete you might need to **manually restart the application** in order to start the application again and get access to the Umbraco backoffice.

## Umbraco 9 Nightly Builds

To get the latest nightly builds - the latest version of the Umbraco dotnet template, you will need to add another NuGet source.

1. Use a command prompt of your choice to insert this custom NuGet feed:

```none
dotnet nuget add source "https://www.myget.org/F/umbraconightly/api/v3/index.json" -n "Umbraco Nightly"
```

2. Install the new Umbraco dotnet template

    ```none
    dotnet new -i Umbraco.Templates::9.0.0-preview*
    ```

In order to get the latest template from the new source, you will need to use a wildcard symbol like shown above.

Now you can continue in the same way as if you were using the [release candidate version](#steps-to-install-the-umbraco-dotnet-new-template)

## Package development

Since Alpha 4, we have added a new template to in `Umbraco.Templates` package which is targeting packages.

To use the new template write:

```none
dotnet new umbracopackage -n MyCustomUmbracoPackage
```

This generates an empty package with an empty `package.manifest`. But more importantly it also contains a `build/MyCustomUmbracoPackage.targets` file.

This file will be included in the NuGet package when using `dotnet pack`.

The file contains an `msbuild` target that is executed on build when a project has a dependency to this package. It copies the `app_plugin` folder into the project. This is required for having Umbraco packages as NuGet packages.

Furthermore, we introduced a new flag on the regular `dotnet new umbraco` template. You can now write:

```none
dotnet new umbraco -n MyCustomUmbracoProject -p MyCustomUmbracoPackage
```

This new `-P` indicates that the project is a test-site of the package `MyCustomUmbracoPackage`. It will add a project dependency to `MyCustomUmbracoPackage` and import the target file from that project. So when you build the new project, it will also copy the `App_Plugins` folder from the package project into the project. In the same way, as if it was a NuGet reference.

### Full example

The following example shows how to use the templates in combination

```none
dotnet new umbracopackage -n MyCustomUmbracoPackage
dotnet new umbraco -n MyCustomUmbracoPackage.Testsite -p MyCustomUmbracoPackage
cd MyCustomUmbracoPackage.Testsite
dotnet build
```

## Umbraco Forms 9 (.NET Core) Beta

On Friday 4th June a beta release of the Umbraco Forms package for V9 was released.

It's available from the Umbraco prerelease MyGet feed used for the CMS betas.

    ```none
    dotnet nuget add source "https://www.myget.org/F/umbracoprereleases/api/v3/index.json" -n "Umbraco Prereleases"
    ```
And the package name is: Umbraco.Forms.9.0.0-beta002.

With an Umbraco V9 application running rc1, you can install the package with the following command:

```none
dotnet add package Umbraco.Forms --version 9.0.0-beta002
```

And then restart the web application with:

```none
dotnet run
```

You'll find the [Forms documentation](Add-ons/UmbracoForms) updated where necessary for V9, mostly around configuration and some changes to method signatures when extending Forms with custom workflow and field types.

If you find any issues, we'd appreciate reports at the [public issue tracker](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.Forms.Issues/issues).  If you could please prefix any issues with "V9: " that would be useful to distinguish them from anything raised for other versions.
