# Reading & using the docs
This is the documentation project for Umbraco. The scope of this project is to provide overviews of concepts, tutorials, example code, and links to API reference.

# What's in the documentation

## Getting started
[Getting started (available here)](Getting-Started/) is an introduction to Umbraco containing explanations of basic concepts and short tutorials..

## Implementation
[Implementation (available here)](Implementation/) is an overview of Umbraco's structure and pipeline.

## Developers Reference
[Reference (available here)](Reference/index.md) is a collection of API references specifically for developers working with and extending Umbraco.

## Extending
[Extending (available here)](Extending/) is documentation on customizing and extending the backoffice.

## Tutorials
[Tutorials (available here)](Tutorials/) is a collection of the more extensive tutorials used in the documentation.

# Markdown conventions
The Umbraco Documentation uses Markdown for all of the documentation, please read about our [Markdown Conventions](Contribute/Markdown-Conventions/).

# Annotating a document

To add version information and extra keywords, [every document can be annotated using YAML](Contribute/adding-metadata.md). 

# Multi version documentation
Every new version of Umbraco introduces new features. This means that every document might not work for your possibly older version.

Therefore we introduced 2 different mechanisms:
1. The [YAML metadata describing](Contribute/adding-metadata.md) `versionFrom` and `versionTo`.
2. The possibility [to add multiple files about the same topic](Contribute/file-naming-conventions.md).
