# Data

*This section focuses on how to create data using the Umbraco backoffice.*

There are three kinds of content in Umbraco:

- Your normal website content that exists in the content section. 
- Media content such as images, videos and PDFs that are stored in the Media section. 
- Finally Members, used for user profiles and frontend authentication which you can find in the Members section.

A fundamental principle in Umbraco is that all content types have a definition (Document Types, Media Types, Member Types). These definitions are highly customizable, meaning you can add properties and have complete control over how the data is organized.
