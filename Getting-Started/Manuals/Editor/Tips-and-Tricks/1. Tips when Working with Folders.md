###1. Refreshing the Tree View

When editing content, the content tree will generally  refresh itself when content is saved. If the tree doesn’t refresh,  or if multiple editors are working on the site, and you want  to have their changes loaded  into your content tree, you can  do this by reloading  parts of the content tree. To reload  a section of the content tree, simply right-click on an item in the tree, and choose the ***Reload nodes***  option  from the context menu. Choosing this option  causes the content tree to refresh itself and its child nodes to reflect any new changes.
