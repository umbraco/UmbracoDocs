# Sections
A section in Umbraco is where you do specific tasks related to that section. For example Content, Settings, and Developer are all sections. You can navigate between the different sections by clicking the corresponding icon in the section menu which is on the left-hand side of the backoffice.

There are eight default sections that come with Umbraco:

### <img src="images/Content.png" style="width:60px;vertical-align:middle" /> Content
The content section contains the content of the website. Content is displayed as nodes in the content tree. In order to create content you must define it using Document Types.

### <img src="images/Media.png" style="width:60px;vertical-align:middle" /> Media
The Media section contains the media for the website. By default you can create folders and upload media files (images and PDFs). You can customize the existing media types or define your own in the Settings section.

### <img src="images/Settings.png" style="width:60px;vertical-align:middle" /> Settings
