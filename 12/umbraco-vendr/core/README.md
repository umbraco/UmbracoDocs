## Using These Docs

**These docs are aimed at developers** who have at least a basic understanding of  [Umbraco](https://umbraco.com), as well as C# / MVC principals.

 To help with the different stages of learning, they have been broken up into 5 key areas, each with a specific focus.

Vendr is the eCommerce solution for Umbraco created by Outfield Digital, the team behind Tea Commerce for Umbraco v7. Vendr is the successor to Tea Commerce and follows much of the same principles but has been vastly improved for use on Umbraco v8+.
