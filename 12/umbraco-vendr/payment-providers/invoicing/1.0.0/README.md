## Using These Docs

**These docs are aimed at developers** looking to implement basic invoice payments in a Vendr eCommerce store. It is expected that you have at least a basic understanding of [Umbraco](https://umbraco.com), as well the [Vendr core product](../../../../core/).

## Getting Help

If you require further assistance, or if you are having a particular issue you can't find an answer to, you can get community support via our support forum over on the [Umbraco developer portal](https://our.umbraco.com/packages/website-utilities/vendr/vendr-support/).

## About Vendr

Vendr is the eCommerce solution for Umbraco v8+ created by Outfield Digital, the team behind Tea Commerce for Umbraco v7. Vendr is the successor to Tea Commerce and follows much of the same principles but has been vastly improved for use on Umbraco v8+.
