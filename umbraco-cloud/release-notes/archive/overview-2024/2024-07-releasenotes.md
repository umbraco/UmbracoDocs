We are excited to announce the launch of the Sustainability Dashboard in Umbraco Cloud. It is a powerful new tool designed to help you monitor and optimize the environmental impact of your cloud projects. As sustainability becomes increasingly important, we are committed to providing tools that empower you to make informed decisions about your digital infrastructure.

Use it to track and analyze the carbon emissions associated with your Umbraco Cloud projects. The dashboard provides clear metrics, helping you understand the environmental impact of your cloud usage.

The Sustainability Dashboard is available now to all Umbraco Cloud users. It is part of our ongoing commitment to supporting greener, more sustainable cloud solutions. We are excited to see how it helps you on your journey towards a more eco-friendly digital presence.

## [Improved error codes and logs](https://docs.umbraco.com/umbraco-cloud/troubleshooting/cloud-errors)

Many operations on Cloud are complex, whether you are pushing Code changes to another environment, upgrading a plan, or adding and removing environments, etc. Most of the time, the operation works as it should, and you can go about your day and continue delivering value to your customers. Sometimes these operations fail for various reasons and require reaching out to support to figure out what is happening and how to get unstuck. With this new addition, we have logs right at your fingertips to help you figure out what went wrong.

## Security Issue Fixed in UmbracoID

Thanks to a report from [Joshua Nibbs](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshua-nibbs/) a high-severity issue has been mitigated, significantly enhancing the security of your projects on Umbraco Cloud.
