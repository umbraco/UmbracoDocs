## Customize Environment Ordering

We've listened to your feedback and are delighted to provide more flexibility and control over how the environments on the Projects Dashboard are listed.

By default, the Live environment is positioned as the first environment, followed by Staging and Development environment. However, we understand that different users may have different workflows and preferences. Therefore, we have introduced the ability to customize the ordering to align with the “left-to-right” deployment model.

Whether you prefer the default order or wish to switch to the "left-to-right" model, the choice is now in your hands.

## All Project Sub-Pages Upgraded

Great news! With the recent migration of the Certificates page to our new front-end tech stack, all project sub-pages have now been successfully converted. This transition marks an important milestone in our ongoing efforts to improve the overall user experience in the Umbraco Cloud Portal.
