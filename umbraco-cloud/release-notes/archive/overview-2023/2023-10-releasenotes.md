## Umbraco CI/CD Flow: Bridging Your CI/CD Pipeline with the Cloud

Umbraco CI/CD Flow represents a significant enhancement in how developers can integrate, test, and deploy their projects on Umbraco Cloud. The feature is engineered to function as an extension to your existing CI/CD pipeline, allowing automated deployments directly to Umbraco Cloud. This creates a synergy between your existing robust CI/CD setup and Umbraco Cloud's specialized hosting capabilities that are optimized for Umbraco CMS.

If you already have a CI/CD pipeline, you're halfway there. Umbraco CI/CD Flow brings an added layer of sophistication by allowing seamless integration with Umbraco Cloud through the "Umbraco Public API."

The basic flow is depicted in the sequence diagram below.
