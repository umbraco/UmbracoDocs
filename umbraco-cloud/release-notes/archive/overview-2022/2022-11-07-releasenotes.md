## [Dedicated for Starter and Standard plan](../../../build-and-customize-your-solution/set-up-your-project/project-settings/dedicated-resources.md)

When "Dedicated resources" was launched in Umbraco Cloud, it was initially only for Professional plans. Since October, it has also been possible to add a dedicated option for **Starter** and **Standard** plans with the benefits included therein.

## Projects Dashboard Quick links

When hovering an environment in the Projects Dashboard you will see a link to the **backoffice** and **front page** of that Umbraco Cloud Project. By pressing one of these links you are navigated to the specific page.

Accessibility is a central consideration in realizing the Projects Dashboard, whereby it is possible to navigate between projects and links using only the keyboard.

## Other Umbraco Cloud Portal updates

During October and November, we provided different small fixes and improvements to the Umbraco Cloud Portal. Here are some of the highlights.

* When inviting a user to a cloud project, an Admin of an organization in Umbraco Cloud will have the opportunity to choose between all the organization's members for quick selection.
* Display of hosting region and dedicated option on the project information page.
* Display the dedication option on the Projects Dashboard.
* Improve messages to users while certain deployment is taking place.
* Ensure that breaking a reference between a baseline and a child project is always depicted in the Projects Dashboard.
* Fix for displaying duplicate project information data when moving back from the project page to Projects Dashboard.
* Fix for Heartcore mini project plan displayed as Starter.
