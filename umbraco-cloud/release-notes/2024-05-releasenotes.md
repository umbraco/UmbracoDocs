## Key Takeaways

* **Upload Custom Database** - You can now upload your Umbraco database to Umbraco Cloud. Add additional text, restoring content is right around the corner.

* **Dedicated Environments** - You can now decide how to best host your Umbraco website with dedicated Environments, with the option to isolate your Live environment on a dedicated server.


## Upload Custom Database

By introducing the Point-In-Time Recovery (PITR) feature on the Backups page, we started the process of enabling backups and restore capabilities of Umbraco Cloud websites. 

This release allows you to upload your custom Umbraco database to Umbraco Cloud. You can either utilize the current backup functionality or bring your own database. We expect the possibility to restore a database to your environment to be available in May or June 2024.

## Dedicated Environments

We’re excited to introduce the ability to isolate your live environment on dedicated resources while keeping your development and staging environments on shared resources. This means your live site enjoys faster load times, reduced latency, and enhanced security without affecting your workflow in development and staging.
