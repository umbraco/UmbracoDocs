* **Hostname Monitoring** – Get notified when your hostnames do not behave as expected, directly from the Cloud Portal.

## Hostname Monitoring

Hostname Monitoring is now available on Umbraco Cloud, giving you better visibility and control over your environment setup.

This feature automatically pings your hostnames from one of the supported regions and verifies that the response is as expected. If a hostname does not respond as expected, you will see it directly in the Cloud Portal.\
This helps you quickly identify and resolve issues that could affect your site’s availability.
