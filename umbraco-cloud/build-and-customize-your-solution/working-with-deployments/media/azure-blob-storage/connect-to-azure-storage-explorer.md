## Getting the credentials

The first thing to sort out, if you want to connect to the Azure Blob Storage container of your environment is the credentials.

To find the connection details for your environment's Blob Storage, follow the steps below:

1. Go to your project on Umbraco Cloud.
2. Go to **Configuration** in the side menu.
3. Go to **Connections.**
4. Scroll down to **Blob Storage Connection Details**
5. Copy down the credentials needed for connecting to Azure Blob Storage.

## Installing Azure Storage Explorer

The next step is to have Azure Storage Explorer installed on your local computer. [Download the storage explorer](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/features/storage-explorer/), and run through the installer.

### Configuring the Connection to your Azure Blob Storage

Let's use the information you have gathered, and connect Azure Storage Explorer to the Blob storage container:
