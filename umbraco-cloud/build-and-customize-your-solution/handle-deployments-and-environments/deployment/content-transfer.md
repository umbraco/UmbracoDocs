# Transferring Content, Media, Members, and Forms

After deploying changes to the metadata, it's time to transfer your content and media. This is done from the Umbraco Backoffice.

Content and media transfers are flexible. You control which content nodes or media items to transfer, all in one go, a few at a time, or a single node.

Transferring content will overwrite any existing nodes on the target environment. Content transfers will transfer the items that you select in the "source" environment to the "target" environment the same as it was in the "source". This means that if you have some content on the target environment already, this will be replaced by the new content from the source environment.

**Important**: Content and Media transfers will only work if you've deployed all changes to your metadata beforehand. Please refer to our documentation on how to deploy metadata from either [Local to Cloud](local-to-cloud.md) or [Cloud to Cloud](cloud-to-cloud.md).

## Step-by-step

Let’s go through a content transfer step by step. Imagine you’ve finished working on new content for your project locally and you are ready to transfer the changes to your Cloud Development environment.

You want to transfer the whole site. You start from the `Home` node and choose to transfer everything under it:

1. Right-click **...** next to the `Home` node in the **Content** tree.
2. Select **Queue for transfer**.
3. Alternatively, if you are in the Home page editor, you can go to the **Actions** dropdown and select **Queue for transfer**.
4. Choose if you want to **include all items below** the chosen page or only transfer the chosen node. Alternatively, right-click the **Content** tree and select **Queue for transfer** to transfer all your content at once.
5. Click **Queue**.
6. Select **Open transfer queue**. The **Workspaces** dashboard opens.
   * You will be able to see which items are currently ready to be transferred - this will include both content and media that you've _queued for transfer_.
7. Click **Transfer to Development** and monitor the progress of the transfer.

Once the transfer is completed, you will see a confirmation message stating that the transfer has succeeded.

### Media Items

Media items are transferred the same way as content:

1. Right-click the items in the **Media** section and select **Queue for transfer**. Alternatively, right-click the Media tree and select **Queue for transfer** to transfer all your media at once.
2. Click **Queue**.
3. Select **Open transfer queue**. The **Workspaces** dashboard opens.
4. Click **Transfer to Development**.

### [Members and Member Groups](https://docs.umbraco.com/umbraco-deploy/deploy-settings#allowmembersdeploymentoperations-and-transfermembergroupsascontent)

To be able to transfer Members and Member groups make sure that `AllowMembersDeploymentOperations` is configured to `transfer` and `TransferMemberGroupsAsContent` is set to `true`. This needs to be done in the `appSettings.json` file

```json
"Umbraco": {
    "Deploy": {
        "Settings": {
            "AllowMembersDeploymentOperations": "Transfer",
            "TransferMemberGroupsAsContent": true,
        }
    }
  }
```

Once the settings have been configured Members can be transferred in the same ways as both content and media from the Members section:

1. Right-click on the **Members** or the **Member Groups** folder and choose **Queue for transfer.**
2. Click Queue.
3. Select **Open transfer queue**. The workspace dashboard opens.
4. Click **Transfer to Development**.

### Umbraco Forms

You'll need to ensure the `TransferFormsAsContent` the setting is set to `true` in the `appsettings.json`file:

```json
"Umbraco": {
    "Deploy": {
        "Settings": {
            "TransferFormsAsContent": true,
        }
    }
  }
```

Once the setting has been added to the source and target environment, Forms can be transferred the same way as content and media:

1. Right-click the items in the Forms section and choose **Queue for transfer**. Alternatively, right-click the Forms tree and select **Queue for transfer** to transfer all your Forms at once.
2. Click **Queue**.
3. Select **Open transfer queue**. The **Workspaces** dashboard opens.
4. Click **Transfer to Development**.

This does not include entries submitted via the forms.
{% endhint %}

### TransferDictionaryAsContent <a href="#transferdictionaryascontent" id="transferdictionaryascontent"></a>

Deploy can be configured to allow for backoffice transfers of dictionary items instead of using files serialized to disk by setting `TransferDictionaryAsContent` as `true`.

```json
"Umbraco": {
    "Deploy": {
        "Settings": {
             "TransferDictionaryAsContent": true,
        }
    }
  }
```

{% hint style="info" %}
When changing the values for`TransferDictionaryAsContent` and `TransferFormsAsContent` to `true,`remove any `.uda` files for Forms and Dictionary entities that have been serialized to disk. These will no longer be updated. By deleting them you avoid any risk of them being processed in the future and inadvertently reverting a form to an earlier state.
{% endhint %}

## Schema Mismatches

Sometimes a content transfer is not possible. For example, adding a new property to the _HomePage_ Document Type that's missing in another Cloud environment throws an error. The error contains details on how to fix it.

If you encounter this issue while transferring content, refer to the [Schema Mismatches](../../../optimize-and-maintain-your-site/monitor-and-troubleshoot/resolve-issues-quickly-and-efficiently/deployments/schema-mismatches.md) article. This article provides guidance on resolving these issues.
