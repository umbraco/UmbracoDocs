# Advanced Setup: Deployment options

Here you will learn how to use the deployment options available with the v2 endpoints for CI/CD.

This provides control over the CI/CD deployment process within the isolated instance before your code is pushed to the Cloud environment.

## Option: skipVersionCheck

During deployment, the system automatically checks for downgrades of Cloud dependencies. This prevents accidental downgrades of packages that may have been automatically upgraded on Umbraco Cloud.

Enabling **skipVersionCheck** will bypass that safeguard and allow deployments that include downgraded packages. 

{% hint style="info" %}
This option increases risk and is not recommended for normal workflows. Only enable it when you understand the package differences and accept the potential consequences.
{% endhint %}

## Option: noBuildAndRestore

The Umbraco CI/CD flow runs the deployment in an isolated instance and performs `dotnet restore` and `dotnet build` to catch obvious build issues before deploying to Cloud. Enabling **noBuildAndRestore** skips the restore and build steps in that isolated instance, which can shorten deployment time by a few minutes.

Keep in mind the final Kudu deployment on the Cloud environment will still run **restore**, **build**, and **publish**; those steps cannot be skipped.

## How to enable the options

All pipeline scripts generally follow the same structure, but there are a few small details to be aware of.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Azure DevOps Bash" %}
Locate the main entry pipeline file. It will usually be this one: `azure-release-pipeline.yaml`.

```yml
  # Deploy to Umbraco Cloud
  # ####
  # you can edit the variables noBuildAndRestore and skipVersionCheck    
  # use booleans but as strings
  - stage: CloudDeploymentStage
    displayName: Deploy To Cloud
    dependsOn: cloudPrepareArtifact
    condition: in(dependencies.cloudPrepareArtifact.result, 'Succeeded')
    variables:
      artifactId: $[ stageDependencies.cloudPrepareArtifact.PrepareAndUploadArtifact.outputs['uploadArtifact.artifactId'] ]
    jobs: 
      - template: cloud-deployment.yml
        parameters:
          artifactId: $(artifactId)
          noBuildAndRestore: 'false'
          skipVersionCheck: 'false'
```

The fields: `noBuildAndRestore` and `skipVersionCheck` can be marked with a `true`. 


{% endtab %}
{% tab title="Azure DevOps PowerShell" %}
Locate the main entry pipeline file. It will usually be this one: `azure-release-pipeline.yaml`.

```yml
  # Deploy to Umbraco Cloud
  # ####
  # you can edit the variables noBuildAndRestore and skipVersionCheck    
  # use booleans
  - stage: CloudDeploymentStage
    displayName: Deploy To Cloud
    dependsOn: cloudPrepareArtifact
    condition: in(dependencies.cloudPrepareArtifact.result, 'Succeeded')
    variables:
      artifactId: $[ stageDependencies.cloudPrepareArtifact.PrepareAndUploadArtifact.outputs['uploadArtifact.artifactId'] ]
    jobs: 
      - template: cloud-deployment.yml
        parameters:
          artifactId: $(artifactId)
          noBuildAndRestore: false
          skipVersionCheck: false

```

The fields: `noBuildAndRestore` and `skipVersionCheck` can be marked with a `true`. 


{% endtab %}
{% tab title="GitHub Actions Bash" %}
Locate the main entry pipeline file. It will usually be this one: `main.yml`.

```yml
  # Deploy to Umbraco Cloud
  # ####
  # you can edit the variables noBuildAndRestore and skipVersionCheck    
  # use booleans but as strings
  cloud-deployment:
    name: "Deploy to Cloud"
    needs: cloud-artifact
    uses: ./.github/workflows/cloud-deployment.yml
    with:
      artifactId: ${{ needs.cloud-artifact.outputs.artifactId }}
      targetEnvironmentAlias: ${{ vars.TARGET_ENVIRONMENT_ALIAS }}
      noBuildAndRestore: "false"
      skipVersionCheck: "false"
    secrets:
      projectId: ${{ secrets.PROJECT_ID }}
      umbracoCloudApiKey: ${{ secrets.UMBRACO_CLOUD_API_KEY }}
```

The fields: `noBuildAndRestore` and `skipVersionCheck` can be marked with a `true`. 

{% endtab %}
{% tab title="GitHub Actions PowerShell" %}
Locate the main entry pipeline file. It will usually be this one: `main.yml`.

```yml
  # Deploy to Umbraco Cloud
  # ####
  # you can edit the variables noBuildAndRestore and skipVersionCheck    
  # use 0 for false and 1 for true
  cloud-deployment:
    name: "Deploy to Cloud"
    needs: cloud-artifact
    uses: ./.github/workflows/cloud-deployment.yml
    with:
      artifactId: ${{ needs.cloud-artifact.outputs.artifactId }}
      targetEnvironmentAlias: ${{ vars.TARGET_ENVIRONMENT_ALIAS }}
      noBuildAndRestore: 0
      skipVersionCheck: 0
    secrets:
      projectId: ${{ secrets.PROJECT_ID }}
      umbracoCloudApiKey: ${{ secrets.UMBRACO_CLOUD_API_KEY }}
```

The fields: `noBuildAndRestore` and `skipVersionCheck` can be marked with a `1`.
