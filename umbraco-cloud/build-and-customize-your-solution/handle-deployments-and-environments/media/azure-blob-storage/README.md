# Azure Blob Storage

This includes everything that is added to the Media library through the Umbraco backoffice, like images, PDFs, and other document formats.

In some cases, you might want to store other files in the Blob Storage than Media files.

Below are two articles describing how to connect to your environment Blob Storage, and upload files either through Azure Storage Explorer or programmatically.

* [Connect to Azure Storage Explorer](connect-to-azure-storage-explorer.md)
* [Connect and Upload Files Programmatically to Azure Blob Storage](connect-programatically-to-azure-storage.md)

You can learn more about Azure Blob Storage in the [Microsoft Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blobs-overview).
