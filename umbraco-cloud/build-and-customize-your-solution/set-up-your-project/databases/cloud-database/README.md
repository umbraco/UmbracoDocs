  There are a few steps you need to do before you can work with your database. 
  You will be ready to start working with the database at the end of the

# Database

## Connecting to your Cloud database locally

Umbraco Cloud automatically overrides whatever is in the `umbracoDbDsn` connection string in the `web.config` or  `appSettings.json` when the site is running on Cloud.&#x20;

Any connection string named `umbracoDbDsn` will only be used when you run the site locally (cloned). In rare cases, you might need the database timeout increased on Cloud, for that, you'll need to reach out to support for assistance.

For security, your database on Umbraco Cloud is running behind a firewall. You'll need to open the firewall for the relevant IPs to connect to the database. This can be a single IP, a list of IPs, or even an IP range.&#x20;

To open the firewall to a specific IP follow the steps below:

1. Go to your Umbraco Cloud Project.
2. Go to **Configuration** in the side menu on your project.
3. Click on **Connections**.
4. Click **Add new IP address** under **SQL Azure firewall rules**
5. Enter the IP that is allowed to access the database.
   1. Give the IP a name as well. his gives an overview of who the different IPs that have been added belong to.

If you don't see the **SQL Azure firewall**, it's due to permissions and you'll need to contact the projects administrator.

The IP can also be added by clicking "**Add now"**. It'll automatically add your current IP address and save the settings. It might take up to five minutes for the firewall to be open for your IP.

### Connecting to the database using SQL Management Studio

Once the firewall is open, it's time to fire up SQL Management Studio and connect to the database. Be aware that a database exists for each environment on Umbraco Cloud. Any changes you make to custom tables need to be done for each database.

To connect to the database using SQL Management Studio follow the steps below:

1. Go to **SQL Connection Details** in the **Configuration** menu on Umbraco Cloud.
2. Note down the **Server name**, **Login**, **Password**, and **Database**.
3. Go to **SQL Management Studio**.
   1. Choose **SQL Server Authentication** as the authentication type In the **Connect to Server** dialog.
   2. Add the Server name in the **Connect to Server** dialog
   3. Add the Login in the **Connect to Server** dialog
   4. Add the Password in the **Connect to Server** dialog
4. Click Options.
5. Add the name of the database in the **Connect to Database** dialog under **Connection properties**.
6. Click **Connect.**

Now that you've connected you can work with the databases on Umbraco Cloud, like you could on any other host. Remember to let Umbraco Cloud do the work when it comes to the Umbraco-related tables (`Umbraco*` and `CMS*` tables).

## LocalDB

{% hint style="info" %}
LocalDB is no longer supported in the latest major version of Umbraco. The documentation below is only relevant if you are on Umbraco 9 and below.
{% endhint %}

When you clone a site locally, Umbraco Cloud automatically creates a local database and populates it with data from your website running on the Cloud. If you don't specify database settings before the local site startup, it defaults to a SQL CE database in the `umbraco/Data` folder. If you wish to use a local SQL Server instead, you can update the connection string in the `web.config` or `appSettings.json` file (from v9+). You need to do this before your site starts up the first time.

By default when Umbraco Cloud restores a local database it will be a `Umbraco.sdf` file in the `/App_Data` folder. However, the restore creates a `Umbraco.mdf` file if LocalDB is installed and configured. To use LocalDB ensure `applicationHost.config` it is configured with `loadUserProfile="true"` and `setProfileEnvironment="true"`.

Read about how to work with LocalDB and full IIS in the [Microsoft documentation](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/sqlexpress/2011/12/08/using-localdb-with-full-iis-part-1-user-profile/).

```xml
<add name="ASP.NET v4.0" autoStart="true" managedRuntimeVersion="v4.0" managedPipelineMode="Integrated">
   <processModel identityType="ApplicationPoolIdentity" loadUserProfile="true" setProfileEnvironment="true" />
</add>
```

{% hint style="info" %}
If you donÂ´t see the lines in the `applicationHost.config`, you can add them manually to the `<applicationPools>` section.
{% endhint %}

Usually `applicationHost.config` is located in this folder for IIS: `C:\Windows\System32\inetsrv\config`

and in one of these folders for IIS Express:

`C:\Users\<user>\Documents\IISExpress\config\`

If you're using Visual Studio 2015+ check this path: `$(solutionDir)\.vs\config\applicationhost.config`

In Visual Studio 2015+ you can also configure which `applicationhost.config` file is used by altering the `<UseGlobalApplicationHostFile>true|false</UseGlobalApplicationHostFile>` setting in the project file (for example, `MyProject.csproj`). Source: Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN) forum.

Now that you are all set and ready you can continue to work with your [database locally](local-database.md).
