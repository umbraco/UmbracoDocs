# Database

## Connecting to your Cloud database locally

Umbraco Cloud automatically overrides whatever is in the `umbracoDbDsn` connection string in the `web.config` or `appSettings.json` when the site is running on Cloud.

Any connection string named `umbracoDbDsn` will only be used when you run the site locally (cloned). In rare cases, you might need the database timeout increased on Cloud, for that, you'll need to reach out to support for assistance.

For security, your database on Umbraco Cloud is running behind a firewall. You'll need to open the firewall for the relevant IPs to connect to the database. This can be a single IP, a list of IPs, or even an IP range.

To open the firewall to a specific IP follow the steps below:

1. Go to your Umbraco Cloud Project.
2. Go to **Configuration** in the side menu on your project.
3. Click on **Connections**.
4. Click **Add new IP address** under **SQL Azure firewall rules**
5. Enter the IP that is allowed to access the database.
   1. Give the IP a name as well. his gives an overview of who the different IPs that have been added belong to.

If you don't see the **SQL Azure firewall**, it's due to permissions and you'll need to contact the projects administrator.

The IP can also be added by clicking "**Add now"**. It'll automatically add your current IP address and save the settings. It might take up to five minutes for the firewall to be open for your IP.

### Connecting to the database using SQL Management Studio

Once the firewall is open, it's time to fire up SQL Management Studio and connect to the database. Be aware that a database exists for each environment on Umbraco Cloud. Any changes you make to custom tables need to be done for each database.

To connect to the database using SQL Management Studio follow the steps below:

1. Go to **SQL Connection Details** in the **Configuration** menu on Umbraco Cloud.
2. Note down the **Server name**, **Login**, **Password**, and **Database**.
3. Go to **SQL Management Studio**.
   1. Choose **SQL Server Authentication** as the authentication type In the **Connect to Server** dialog.
   2. Add the Server name in the **Connect to Server** dialog
   3. Add the Login in the **Connect to Server** dialog
   4. Add the Password in the **Connect to Server** dialog
4. Click Options.
5. Add the name of the database in the **Connect to Database** dialog under **Connection properties**.
6. Click **Connect.**

Now that you've connected you can work with the databases on Umbraco Cloud, like you could on any other host. Remember to let Umbraco Cloud do the work when it comes to the Umbraco-related tables (`Umbraco*` and `CMS*` tables).

## LocalDB

{% hint style="info" %}
LocalDB is no longer supported in the latest major version of Umbraco. The information below is only relevant if you are on Umbraco 9 and below.
{% endhint %}

When you clone a site locally, Umbraco Cloud automatically creates a local database and populates it with data from your website running on the Cloud. If you don't specify database settings before the local site startup, it defaults to a SQL CE database in the `umbraco/Data` folder. If you wish to use a local SQL Server instead, you can update the connection string in the `web.config` or `appSettings.json` file (from v9+). You need to do this before your site starts up the first time.

By default when Umbraco Cloud restores a local database it will be a `Umbraco.sdf` file in the `/App_Data` folder. However, the restore creates a `Umbraco.mdf` file if LocalDB is installed and configured. To use LocalDB ensure `applicationHost.config` it is configured with `loadUserProfile="true"` and `setProfileEnvironment="true"`.

Read about how to work with LocalDB and full IIS in the [Microsoft documentation](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/sqlexpress/2011/12/08/using-localdb-with-full-iis-part-1-user-profile/).

```xml
<add name="ASP.NET v4.0" autoStart="true" managedRuntimeVersion="v4.0" managedPipelineMode="Integrated">
   <processModel identityType="ApplicationPoolIdentity" loadUserProfile="true" setProfileEnvironment="true" />
</add>
```

{% hint style="info" %}
If you donÂ´t see the lines in the `applicationHost.config`, you can add them manually to the `<applicationPools>` section.
{% endhint %}

Usually `applicationHost.config` is located in this folder for IIS: `C:\Windows\System32\inetsrv\config`

and in one of these folders for IIS Express:

`C:\Users\<user>\Documents\IISExpress\config\`

If you're using Visual Studio 2015+ check this path: `$(solutionDir)\.vs\config\applicationhost.config`

In Visual Studio 2015+ you can also configure which `applicationhost.config` file is used by altering the `<UseGlobalApplicationHostFile>true|false</UseGlobalApplicationHostFile>` setting in the project file (eg: `MyProject.csproj`). Source: Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN) forum.

Now that you are all set and ready you can continue to work with your [database locally](broken-reference).

## Connecting to the Database on Mac

### Prerequisite

* An Umbraco Cloud project
* [Whitelisted IP](https://docs.umbraco.com/umbraco-cloud/databases/cloud-database#opening-the-firewall) on Umbraco Cloud
* [Azure Data Studio](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/data-studio)

### Connecting to the Database

Follow the steps below to connect and work with your Umbraco Cloud Database on a Mac.

1. Go to **SQL Connection Details** in the **Configuration** menu on Umbraco Cloud.
2. Note down the **Server name**, **Login**, **Password**, and **Database**.

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (2) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>SQL Connection Details on Umbraco Cloud</p></figcaption></figure>

3. Open **Azure Data Studio**.
4. Click "**Create a connection**" on the welcome page in Azure Data Studio.

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (2) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Create a Connection in Azure Data Studio</p></figcaption></figure>

5. Change the Authentication type to SQL Login and enter the following information in the Connection details dialog:
   1. Add the **Server name.**
   2. Add the **Login**.
   3. Add the **Password**.
   4. Add the **Database**.

<div data-full-width="false"><figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (3) (1) (1) (1).png" alt="" width="375"><figcaption><p>Entering connection details in Azure Data Studio</p></figcaption></figure></div>

6. Click **Connect** once the connection details have been filled out.

You have now connected to your database. You can work with the databases on Umbraco Cloud like you could on any other host. Remember to let Umbraco Cloud do the work when it comes to the Umbraco-related tables (`Umbraco*` and `CMS*` tables).

## Working with a Cloud database locally

This section covers how you can connect to the database of your local project and how you can work with custom tables on Umbraco Cloud.

### Connecting to your local Umbraco installation

When cloning down your project to work locally you might want to have a look in your database every now and then.

Since Umbraco 10, **SQL CE** is no longer supported, instead, Umbraco now comes with **SQLite** out of the box.

When cloning down your Umbraco project and restoring its content, it will create a `Umbraco.sqlite.db` file in `~/umbraco/Data/Umbraco.sqlite.db`.

To view your local SQLite database, you will need to use a program like [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/) or a Visual Studio extension like [SQLite and SQL Server Compact Toolbox](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ErikEJ.SQLServerCompactSQLiteToolbox).

You can also configure your project to prefer SQL Server LocalDb when it's available on your local machine by enabling the Deploy [`PreferLocalDbConnectionString`](https://docs.umbraco.com/umbraco-deploy/deploy-settings#preferlocaldbconnectionstring) setting.

To configure your database, you can add the connection string in the 'appsettings.json' file. For more information, see the [Configure your database](https://docs.umbraco.com/umbraco-cms/fundamentals/setup/install/unattended-install#configure-your-database) section in the [Unattended Installs](https://docs.umbraco.com/umbraco-cms/fundamentals/setup/install/unattended-install) article.

### Using Custom Tables with Umbraco Cloud

Umbraco Cloud will ensure that your Umbraco-related data is always up to date, but it won't know anything about data in custom tables unless told. This is like any other host when it comes to non-Umbraco data.

However, you have full access to the SQL Azure databases running on Umbraco Cloud. You can create custom tables like you'd expect on any other hosting provider. The easiest way to do this is to [connect using SQL Management Studio](cloud-database.md#connecting-to-your-cloud-database-locally).

The recommended way of making sure custom tables are present is to use Migrations. This is to ensure that the tables will be created or altered when starting your site.

Migrations will ensure if you add environments to your Umbraco Cloud site, the tables in the newly created databases will automatically be created for you.

Check the [Creating a Custom Database table](https://docs.umbraco.com/umbraco-cms/extending/database) for an example of how to create and use Migrations.
