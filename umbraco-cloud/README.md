How to create a trial
{% endembed %}

Umbraco Cloud takes care of installation, infrastructure, and security. You will also get the tools to work with your project in the Cloud or locally. Local development starts with cloning the project down to your PC or Linux/macOS.

When you are ready to show your work to the world, Umbraco Cloud provides a safe deployment mechanism that lets you publish to the web. When you have changes or updates to your site, Umbraco Cloud follows the process of moving, testing, and deploying your changes to your public site.

## Umbraco Cloud Plans

Umbraco Cloud offers shared hosting in 3 different plans:

* Starter
* Standard
* Professional

Learn more about the [quotas put in place](getting-started/umbraco-cloud-plans.md) to ensure the stability of your website.

## Umbraco Cloud Project

The easiest way to start with an Umbraco Cloud project is to take a [14-day free trial](https://try.umbraco.com/cloud). The project is automatically created and you are ready to start within a few minutes.

Since everything is already set up for you, it is recommended that you get to know your project before you start building.

To start working with and building your site, you can either work directly in the backoffice on the Cloud environment or [clone down the project to your local machine](set-up/working-locally.md).
