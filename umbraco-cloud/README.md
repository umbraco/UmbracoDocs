## Umbraco Cloud Plans

Umbraco Cloud offers shared hosting in 3 different plans:

* Starter
* Standard
* Professional

You can [learn more about quotas](getting-started/umbraco-cloud-plans.md) that are put in place to ensure the stability of your website.

## Umbraco Cloud Project

The easiest way to get started with an Umbraco Cloud project is to take a [14-day free trial](https://umbraco.com/?product\_tour\_id=103162). The project is automatically created and you are ready to get started within a few minutes.

Since we set up the entire project, we recommend that you get to know your project before you start building.

To start working with and building your site, you can either work directly in the backoffice on the Cloud environment or you can [clone down the project to your local machine](set-up/working-locally.md). For Linux or macOS users, see [Working with Linux/macOS](set-up/working-with-linux-macos.md).

### Umbraco Cloud Portal Project

To create a project in Umbraco Cloud Portal:

1. Log in to the [Umbraco Cloud Portal](https://www.s1.umbraco.io/projects) with your credentials.
2.  Click **Create project**.

### Naming a Project

When you create a:

* Trial project for the first time - a unique project name will be generated for you.
* Project from the Umbraco Cloud Portal - you will get to choose a name for the project.

To rename the project file and folder, see the [Renaming the Project file and folder](set-up/project-settings/#renaming-the-project-file-and-folder) article.

An Umbraco Cloud project name is unique, which means if a project with the name you choose already exists, you will need to choose another name before you can create the project.

1. Log in to the [Umbraco Cloud Portal](https://www.s1.umbraco.io/projects) with your credentials.

3.  Click on **Overview** from the left side menu..

Umbraco Cloud takes care of installation, infrastructure, and security. You will also get the tools to work with your project in the Cloud or locally. Local development starts with cloning the project down to your PC or Linux/macOS.

When you are ready to show your work to the world, Umbraco Cloud provides a safe deployment mechanism that lets you publish to the web. When you have changes or updates to your site, Umbraco Cloud follows the process of moving, testing, and deploying your changes to your public site.
