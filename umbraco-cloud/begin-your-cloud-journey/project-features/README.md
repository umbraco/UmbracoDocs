# Project Features

Umbraco Cloud Projects are made of three major components: Environments, Team Members/Invite Users, and Settings.

## Environments

The number of Environments in your project is dependent on which plan you are on:

<table><thead><tr><th width="117">Plan</th><th width="116" data-type="number">Environments</th><th width="167" data-type="checkbox">Flexible Environments</th><th>Environment Combinations Examples</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Starter</td><td>2</td><td>false</td><td><em>QA + Production</em></td></tr><tr><td>Standard</td><td>3</td><td>true</td><td><em>Flexible + QA + Production</em><br><em>Development + QA + Production</em></td></tr><tr><td>Professional</td><td>4</td><td>true</td><td><em>Flexible + Development + QA + Production</em></td></tr></tbody></table>

To get a technical overview of your Cloud environments, see the [Environments](environments.md) article. For more information on how to add or remove environments, see the [Manage Environments](../../build-and-customize-your-solution/handle-deployments-and-environments/manage-environments.md) article.

## Team Members/Invite Users

Another major component of your Umbraco Cloud project is Team Members. When you add team members to a project, they will automatically be added as backoffice users in all the environments. Team members can be added as _Admins_, _Writers_, or _Readers_. Refer to the [Team Members](team-members/) article to learn more about these roles.

## Settings

There are many different settings available for you to configure your project for your needs. Learn more about the settings in the [Project Settings](../../build-and-customize-your-solution/set-up-your-project/project-settings/) article.
