# External Login Providers

The External Login Providers feature in Umbraco Cloud allows you to integrate third-party authentication systems to manage backoffice user logins securely and efficiently. This functionality is especially useful for teams that want to simplify login management or use their existing identity systems.

{% hint style="info" %}
This feature is currently only available for backoffice logins.
{% endhint %}

Using OpenID Connect, Umbraco Cloud supports external login providers such as Microsoft Entra ID, Auth0, Google, and so on. This feature helps administrators manage backoffice access, assign user roles, and improve security.

This guide shows you how to set up and configure external login providers for your Cloud projects. It includes the following steps:

* [Prepare your login provider](external-login-providers.md#prepare-your-login-provider)
* [Register the login provider on Umbraco Cloud](external-login-providers.md#register-the-login-provider-on-umbraco-cloud)

Additionally, you can explore a few examples in the section below:

* [Configuration scenarios](external-login-providers.md#configuration-scenarios)

## Requirements

To use the External Login Provider feature on Umbraco Cloud there are the following requirements:

* Any cloud project based on:
  * Umbraco 13 with Umbraco.Cloud.Identity.Cms 13.2.1 or higher installed
  * Umbraco 14 with Umbraco.Cloud.Identity.Cms 14.2.1 or higher installed
  * Umbraco 15 with Umbraco.Cloud.Cms 15.1.1 or higher installed
  * Or [Umbraco Heartcore](https://docs.umbraco.com/umbraco-heartcore)

You can use any login provider that supports the Open ID Connect protocol.

This guide covers implementing the following External Login Providers with Cloud:

* Microsoft Entra ID
* Auth0
* Google

{% hint style="info" %}
Make sure you have set up a tenant or organization in the provider.
{% endhint %}

## Prepare your login provider

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Microsoft Entra ID" %}
1. Access the Microsoft Azure Portal.
2. Locate the Microsoft Entra ID and enter your tenant.
3. Select **Add**.

![Select Add and then choose App Registration to start registering your app](../../build-and-customize-your-solution/set-up-your-project/project-settings/images/elp-azure-2.png)

4. Choose **App registration**.
5. Register your app.
   * Ignore the Redirect URI as that will be covered later in the guide.

## Configuration Fields

Learn about what type of data and information you need for each field in the configuration form.

<table><thead><tr><th width="227">Field</th><th>Description</th><th>Formatting</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Alias</td><td>A unique alias for the provider.</td><td><p>Use only lower-case.</p><p>Spaces are not allowed.</p></td></tr><tr><td>Client Id</td><td>A unique Client ID generated in the external login provider.</td><td>Entra ID: Guid<br>Auth0: Random characters<br>Google: <code>{randomchars}.apps.googleusercontent.com</code></td></tr><tr><td>Client Secret</td><td>A secret that is generated in the External Login Provider and is associated with the Client Id.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Authority</td><td>The URL for the External Login Provider. This can be found in the External Login Provider.</td><td>Entra ID: <code>https://login.microsoftonline.com/&#x3C;Directory (tenant)></code><br>Auth0: <code>https://{accountId}.uk.auth0.com</code><br>Google: <code>https://accounts.google.com</code></td></tr><tr><td>Scopes</td><td>These are OpenID-Connect scopes. These are the minimum requirement and will allow the app to authenticate and get the users profile data, email and name.</td><td>Default values: <code>openid</code>, <code>profile</code> and <code>email</code>.</td></tr><tr><td>Auth Type</td><td>Currently only OpenIDConnect is available.</td><td>Default: <code>OpenIdConnect</code></td></tr><tr><td>Default User Group</td><td>Choose which <strong>Umbraco User Group</strong> the user should be assigned to if nothing else is defined.<br>Custom User Group added to the backoffice will also be available.</td><td>Default Options:<br><code>Administrators</code><br><code>Writers</code><br><code>Editors</code><br><code>Translators</code><br><code>Sensitive Data</code></td></tr><tr><td>Enforce User Group on login</td><td>A checkbox to choose whether each login will re-evaluate the users role or if it should happen only on the first login.</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>User Group Mappings</td><td>Use this field to map roles within the login provider with Umbraco User Groups.<br><br><em>Example: A user with the "Content Editor" role in the login provider, will be added to the Writer User Group in Umbraco.</em></td><td><code>Login Provider Role</code> = <code>Umbraco User Group</code><br><br>Entra ID: <code>Object ID of User Group</code> = <code>Umbraco User Group</code></td></tr><tr><td>No User Group Found Behaviour</td><td>This decides what happens if the mapping for the users User Group hasn't been defined. The options are to select the Default User Group or to disallow the user access to the backoffice.</td><td>Options: <code>UseDefaultUserGroup</code>, <code>Unauthorized</code></td></tr><tr><td>User Group Claim Name</td><td>Your provider may assign users to specific roles (For example: Admin, Editor, Viewer).<br><br>The <strong>User Group Claim Name</strong> is the field in the authentication token (claim) that identifies these roles. The system reads this claim to determine a user’s permissions.<br><br>Example: If your provider sends roles in a claim named <code>user_roles</code>, you would set the <strong>User Group Claim Name</strong> to <code>user_roles</code> so the system can properly recognize user permissions.</td><td>Entra ID: <code>email (ID)</code>, <code>groups</code></td></tr><tr><td>Metadata Address</td><td>If you need a special metadata address for your External Login Provider, you can set it here. By default, the system will resolve the metadata address from the Authority Url, which is why this property is optional.</td><td>A common scenario for using a special metadata address is when working with Entra ID and configuring claims mapping. In this case, you must set the metadata address to the following:<code>https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant}/v2.0/.well-known/openid-configuration?appid={client-id}</code></td></tr></tbody></table>

### Handling invites when using an External Login Provider

When using an External Login Provider, the invitation flow to the backoffice can no longer be managed within Umbraco. This is because users must first be created in the External Login Provider before they can log in. Umbraco Cloud does not handle this integration.

As an administrator, you are responsible for managing user access to the backoffice.

Send users an email with a backoffice link, instructing them to click "Login with \[your login provider]".

### Configuration scenarios

The following scenarios showcase how to use the configuration options when setting up the external login provider.

You can use the scenarios to learn how to configure the External Login Provider to fit your needs.

#### Scenario 1: Default User Group for all users

Any user that will be authenticated via the external login provider will end up in a default Umbraco backoffice User Group. As an admin, it will be your job to distribute the users into groups if needed.

* Configure the **Default User Group** field, to specify which group all users should be added to by default.

#### Scenario 2: Evaluate the User Group on each login

Any user authenticated via the external login provider will always end up in the same Umbraco backoffice User Group. The group will be re-evaluated on each login, allowing you to change the group all users are in.

* Configure the **Default User Group** field with the User Group all users should be added to.
* Enable the **Enforce User Group on login**.

#### Scenario 3: Role-based User Group mapping with fallback to Default User Group

Any user authenticated via the external login provider can have a role claim associated with its login. This claim can then map to a backoffice User Group. A user with a role that cannot be mapped will end up in a default group.

* Configure the **Default User Group** with the User Group that should be the fallback group.
* Select **User Default User Group** under the **No User Group Found Behaviour** setting.
* Fill in the **User Group Mappings** map.
* Enable **Enforce User Group on login**.

#### Scenario 4: Role-based User Group mapping with fallback to deny access

Any user authenticated via the external login provider can have a role claim associated with its login. This claim can map to a backoffice User Group. If no roles match this claim, the user is denied access to the Umbraco backoffice.

* Select **Unauthorized** in the **No User Group Found Behaviour** setting.
* Fill in the **User Group Mappings** map.
* Enable **Enforce User Group on login**.
