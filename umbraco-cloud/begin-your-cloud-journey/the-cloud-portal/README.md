# The Cloud Portal

The Umbraco Cloud Portal helps you manage your Umbraco Cloud project. From here, you can view and manage all your Cloud projects in one place.

## Umbraco Cloud Portal Overview

When you log in to the [Umbraco Cloud Portal](https://www.s1.umbraco.io/home/login/), the projects dashboard gives an overview of all your Umbraco Cloud projects. Here, you can view all the projects you've created or have been added to as a team member.

![The Umbraco Cloud Portal - Projects Dashboard](images/Umbraco-cloud-portal-projects-dashboard.png)

You can see the project's environments, usage for each project, and which plans it is on. You can also see whether it is a baseline or baseline-child project.

In the top-right corner of the Umbraco Cloud Portal, you will find:

* **Create New Project** - Allows you to create more projects using the plan you wish and a project will be ready for you within a few minutes.
* **Notifications** - You can also see notifications for your different projects. For example: if your project has been automatically updated or if an upgrade has failed.
* **Profile** - Manage projects, subscriptions, pending invites, organization information, profile details, view release notes, and log out of the portal.

## Project Groups

### Settings

In the right-side corner of the Umbraco Cloud Portal, you can enable **Show environments** and **Show usage** of the project from the **Settings** option.

To manage the environments in your project, click **Create Environments** to add or remove environments as needed. For more information on how the number of environments varies by plan, refer to the [Project Overview](../project-features/) article.
