# Hostname Monitoring

Hostname monitoring in Umbraco Cloud allows users to track the availability and response times of their websites. This feature helps ensure optimal website performance and alerts users to potential downtime or performance issues. Users can add, edit, and view hostname monitors through the Umbraco Cloud Portal. A historical overview of uptime is available in the **Ping Results** section.

Hostname monitoring can be accessed under **Insights > Hostname Monitoring** on your project in the Umbraco Cloud Portal.

## Hostname Monitor Configuration

* **Hostname**: The domain or subdomain to monitor (e.g., `https://example.com` or `http://web.example.com`). Users can also monitor hostnames outside of Umbraco Cloud, such as static frontend websites hosted elsewhere for Heartcore projects.
* **Frequency**: The interval at which the hostname is checked (e.g., every X minutes). Valid values: 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 360, 720, 1440 minutes.
* **Locations**: Users can select multiple locations to ping the web application from. Supported regions include Europe, the US, Australia, and the UK.
* **Max Response Time**: The maximum acceptable response time in seconds. Must be greater than 0.
* **Expected Status Code**: The HTTP status code that indicates a successful response (e.g., `200`, `301`, `404`). Any status code can be monitored, and this value determines whether the UI marks the response as a failure or success.
* **Monitor Enabled**: Toggle to enable or disable monitoring. Disabling a monitor stops the pings but retains history in **Ping Results**.

## ASP.NET Core Health Checks Example

You can use [ASP.NET Core Health Checks](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/health-checks?view=aspnetcore-9.0) to monitor the health of your application and its dependencies.

The simplest health check implementation looks like this:

```csharp
// Add health checks
builder.Services.AddHealthChecks();

// Map health check endpoint
app.MapHealthChecks("/health");
```

After creating a health check endpoint (e.g. `/health`) and implementing the `IHealthCheck` interface, your application can expose its internal state by returning a standard HTTP status:

* `200 OK` if healthy  
* `503 Service Unavailable` or similar if unhealthy

Umbraco Cloud hostname monitoring checks any path, like `https://customhostname.com/health`, using HTTP response codes to determine if the application is reachable and healthy.

## Ping Results

* Displays logs of pings, including:
  * Timestamp
  * Duration
  * Monitoring server location
  * Response code
* A response code different from `200` may indicate an issue.

The Ping Results table also shows [platform and CMS events](availability-performance.md#platform-and-cms-events), making it possible to see how different events impact performance.

## Plan Limitations

| Plan     | Lowest Frequency | Max Locations | Historical Data | Hostnames Monitors Supported |
| -------- | ---------------- | ------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Starter  | 15 minutes       | 1             | 1 month         | 1                            |
| Standard | 10 minutes       | 2             | 3 months        | 5                            |
| Pro      | 5 minutes        | All           | 12 months       | 20                           |

## Notes

* A Ping Result response code of `-7` indicates a timeout. The hostname was unreachable within the timeout period of 60 seconds.
* Ensure that monitored hostnames resolve correctly and are accessible to avoid false alerts.

## Negative Status Codes

Hostname monitoring shows a number of custom HTTP response codes beyond the standard. These response codes are based on [Chromium's response codes](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:net/base/net_error_list.h) and give you more details about error responses.
