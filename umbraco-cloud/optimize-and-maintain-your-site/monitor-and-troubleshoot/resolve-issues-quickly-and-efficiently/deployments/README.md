# Troubleshooting deployments

Issues with deployments on Umbraco Cloud often come down to a misunderstanding of how to work with Umbraco Cloud. It is important to always work left to right, as mentioned in the [Deployment section](../../../../build-and-customize-your-solution/handle-deployments-and-environments/deployment/).

There are two ways to deploy on Umbraco Cloud, a deployment that transfers content and media:

1. A Content [Transfer](../../../../build-and-customize-your-solution/handle-deployments-and-environments/deployment/content-transfer.md) / [Restore](../../../../build-and-customize-your-solution/handle-deployments-and-environments/deployment/restoring-content/).
2. A [Deployment](../../../../build-and-customize-your-solution/handle-deployments-and-environments/deployment/cloud-to-cloud.md) that transfers structure files (doc types, data types, templates, dll's, etc.).

There are some common errors associated with both of these. Most of the time, it is caused by conflicting [UDA files](../../power-tools/generating-uda-files.md#what-are-uda-files) between the two environments you are deploying between.

The most common [Deployment](../../../../build-and-customize-your-solution/handle-deployments-and-environments/deployment/cloud-to-cloud.md) issues are listed below with guides on how to fix them:

* [Collision Errors](structure-error.md).
* [Dependency Exception](dependency-exceptions.md).
* [Colliding Data Types](colliding-datatypes.md).
* [Language Mismatch](language-mismatch.md).
* [Deployment Failed (with no error message)](deployment-failed.md).
* [Changes not being applied](changes-not-being-applied.md).

The most common Content [Transfer](../../../../build-and-customize-your-solution/handle-deployments-and-environments/deployment/content-transfer.md)/[Restore](../../../../build-and-customize-your-solution/handle-deployments-and-environments/deployment/restoring-content/) issues are listed below:

* [Schema mismatch](schema-mismatches.md).
* [SQL Timeouts](https://docs.umbraco.com/umbraco-deploy/deploy-settings#timeout-settings).
* [Dependency Exception](dependency-exceptions.md).
* [Media path too long](path-too-long-exception.md).

With the introduction of Flexible Environments, the chance of getting merge conflicts on Umbraco Cloud has increased. Read more about what to do in case of merge conflicts and how to avoid them.
