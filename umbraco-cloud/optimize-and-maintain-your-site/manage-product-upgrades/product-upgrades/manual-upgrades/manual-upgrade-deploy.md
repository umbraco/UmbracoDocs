# Manual upgrade of Umbraco Deploy

Deploy on Cloud will either be automatically upgraded with patch releases or it can be done through the portal when new minors are available.

In rare cases, Deploy might not be on the latest patch or minor and you will need to upgrade Deploy manually.

This article will give you a step-by-step on how to manually upgrade the deployment engine used on your Umbraco Cloud project.

## Prepare for the upgrade

When upgrading an Umbraco Cloud project manually, the first step is to [clone down your Cloud Development environment to your local machine](../../../../build-and-customize-your-solution/handle-deployments-and-environments/working-locally/).

Make sure you can run your Cloud project locally and restore content and media. It is important that you check that everything works correctly after the upgrade. To achieve this, you need to have a clone locally that resembles the Cloud environment as much as possible.

## Get the latest version of Umbraco

To get the latest version of Umbraco Deploy you will need to upgrade the site using NuGet. The main package to install is `Umbraco.Deploy.Cloud`. This has dependencies on other components of Umbraco Deploy that will be imported automatically.

If using Umbraco Forms in your installation, you should also update the `Umbraco.Deploy.Forms` package reference.

1. Run the `dotnet add package Umbraco.Deploy.Cloud` command in the directory that contains your project files. If you want a specific package version, run these commands:
  
  - `dotnet add package Umbraco.Deploy.Cloud --version <VERSION>`
  - `dotnet add package Umbraco.Deploy.Forms --version <VERSION>`

2. Run `dotnet restore` to install the packages.

3. Open your `.csproj` file to make sure the package reference is updated:

```xml
<ItemGroup>
  <PackageReference Include="Umbraco.Deploy.Cloud" Version="9.0.1" />
  <PackageReference Include="Umbraco.Deploy.Forms" Version="9.0.1" />
</ItemGroup>
```

Alternatively, you can also update Umbraco Deploy via the **NuGet Package Manager** in Visual studio:

Make sure that everything works on the local clone and that you can **run the project without any errors**.
