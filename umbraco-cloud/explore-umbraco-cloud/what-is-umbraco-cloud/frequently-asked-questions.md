# Frequently asked questions

This section provides answers to common technical questions about Umbraco Cloud, specifically for developers. If you're looking for general product information, visit the [FAQ on our website](https://umbraco.com/products/umbraco-cloud/faq/).

## General

### Can I try Umbraco Cloud before purchasing?

Yes, you can [start a free 14-day trial](https://try.umbraco.com/cloud) with no obligation to buy.

### Does Umbraco Cloud use a special version of Umbraco?

No, it runs on the latest publicly available version of Umbraco.

### Can Umbraco Cloud handle high-traffic sites?

A well-built site with around 50,000 daily visitors (\~1.5 million monthly) performs well on Umbraco Cloud. For business-critical, high-traffic sites, consider Umbraco Cloud Professional or Enterprise, possibly with a dedicated server.

### Does Umbraco Cloud support auto-scaling or dedicated worker resources?

Auto-scaling is not available yet but is under consideration. However, we do offer dedicated worker resources. [Contact Us](https://umbraco.com/contact-us/) to learn more.

### Can I set up a load-balanced site on Umbraco Cloud?

No, load balancing is not currently supported.

### Can I migrate my site away from Umbraco Cloud?

Yes. Since Umbraco Cloud uses the standard Umbraco version, you can:

* Clone your site.
* Restore your data locally.
* Delete your Umbraco Cloud project.

While leaving is unfortunate, choosing the best solution for your needs is always supported.

### Can I move my existing site to Umbraco Cloud?

Umbraco Cloud works best as the foundation for a new project. While migration is possible, adjustments may be needed to align with Umbraco Cloud’s workflow. For more details, see the [Migrate to Umbraco Cloud](../../begin-your-cloud-journey/creating-a-cloud-project/migrate-to-umbraco-cloud.md) article.

### What languages are available for content localization on Umbraco Cloud?

Umbraco Cloud uses Azure infrastructure for localization in Umbraco CMS. You can find the available languages in the dropdown below.

## Technology

### What server environment does an Umbraco Cloud site run on?

All Umbraco Cloud plans use P1V3 Azure App Service Plans as their underlying infrastructure, which includes:

* 2 CPU Cores
* 8GB of RAM
* 250 GB Disk space
* 1,920 Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connections

### How many resources are available for a website?

Quotas for different Umbraco Cloud plans can be found in the [Umbraco Cloud Plans](umbraco-cloud-plans.md) article.

Each plan also has hostname limitations, which are listed in the [pricing details](https://umbraco.com/umbraco-cloud-pricing/). Most Cloud sites operate within these limits, but solutions are available for those requiring additional resources.

Website usage and performance can be monitored through the [Usage](https://docs.umbraco.com/umbraco-cloud/set-up/project-settings/usage) and the [Availability & Performance](https://docs.umbraco.com/umbraco-cloud/set-up/project-settings/availability-performance) pages.

* The 'Usage' page provides details on bandwidth consumption.
* The 'Availability & Performance' page allows monitoring of CPU and memory usage.

{% hint style="info" %}
For questions about resource usage, contact the support team.
{% endhint %}

### Can Cloudflare be used with Umbraco Cloud?

Yes. Hostnames managed in a customer's Cloudflare (CF) zone can be enrolled as **DNS Only** or via [the hostname pre-validation flow](https://docs.umbraco.com/umbraco-cloud/go-live/manage-hostnames/hostname-pre-validation) in the [orange-to-orange configuration](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/saas-customers/how-it-works/). 

- [Orange-to-orange configuration](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/saas-customers/how-it-works/) is the recommended approach for maximum control, as you get to keep full control of your Edge configuration. In an orange-to-orange configuration, any Umbraco Cloud Cloudflare provided features, such as Managed Challenge, Web Application Firewall (WAF), can be stacked or disabled and managed manually in the customer zone.
- The **DNS Only** configuration is the recommended approach for minimum custom Cloudflare maintenance. In the **DNS Only** configuration, the customers' Cloudflare zone won't apply DDoS protection or Web Application Firewall, and the Umbraco Cloud Cloudflare features will continue working.

It is worth mentioning that Umbraco Cloud websites already provide many baseline Cloudflare features such as DDoS or Web Application Firewall by default.

### Does Cloudflare add additional HTTP request headers?

All HTTP requests to custom hostnames on Umbraco Cloud pass through Cloudflare, which adds extra HTTP headers. These headers provide location-based information that can be useful for multilingual sites, redirections, or analytics.

**Location headers:**

* `cf-ipcity`: Visitor's city
* `cf-ipcontinent`: Visitor's continent
* `cf-iplatitude`: Visitor's latitude
* `cf-iplongitude`: Visitor's longitude
* `uc-ipcountry`: Visitor’s country (identical to [cf-ipcountry](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/get-started/reference/http-request-headers/#cf-ipcountry)).

{% hint style="info" %}
These headers are available for all custom hostnames added to Umbraco Cloud. However, they are not present on the default Umbraco Cloud hostname, such as `project.euwest01.umbraco.io`.
{% endhint %}

### Which Umbraco versions are available on Umbraco Cloud?

All supported versions of Umbraco CMS are available on Umbraco Cloud. The [Long-Term Support & End-of-Life](https://umbraco.com/products/knowledge-center/long-term-support-and-end-of-life/) page provides more details on supported versions.

## Upgrades

### When is Umbraco upgraded in different projects?

Upgrade occurs the first Tuesday after a new patch version of Umbraco CMS, Forms, or Deploy has been released.

### How do automated upgrades work?

Cloud projects are automatically upgraded to the latest patch and minor version of Umbraco CMS, Forms, and Deploy. Each new patch version is first tested with a test suite, then on 10 test sites. If successful, the upgrade is rolled out in batches of 100 customer accounts.

[Read more about upgrades](https://docs.umbraco.com/umbraco-cloud/product-upgrades/product-upgrades)

### Why didn’t my project receive the auto-upgrade?

Auto-upgrades are rolled out after verifying that all environments respond without errors. If any environment returns an HTTP status error, the upgrade process is aborted.

Other reasons for missing the upgrade:

* A failed test after applying the auto-upgrade, which compares environment states before and after the upgrade. If discrepancies are found, the environment is rolled back.
* Active deployments during the upgrade attempt.
* Environments running different minor versions, such as one environment on 15.0.x and another on 15.1.x.

For more details, see the [Upgrades](../../optimize-and-maintain-your-site/manage-product-upgrades/product-upgrades/README.md#the-process-of-auto-upgrading-a-umbraco-cloud-project) article.

### Do pending commits between environments derail the upgrade process?

Pending commits do not stop the auto-upgrade.

### Is it OK to do manual upgrades?

Yes, manual upgrades are fine, such as upgrading from 15.1.1 to 15.1.2 locally. If you need to upgrade before the scheduled service upgrade or if an automatic upgrade failed, you can perform a manual update. However, you will need to run the upgrade installer manually on each environment, including live.

### Will customized files be overwritten during upgrades?

Any default Umbraco files may be overwritten during upgrades. This usually affects only files changed in the newest release, but there’s no guarantee. For example, if you’ve customized the login page, it will likely be reverted after each upgrade.

## Testing

### Can I perform penetration tests on my Umbraco Cloud site?

Yes, you can conduct penetration tests on your Cloud site. However, please inform Support beforehand so the team can monitor for any unusual activity.

Test results are welcome to help improve Umbraco's security. Contact Support via the chat button at the bottom right of the [Umbraco Cloud portal](https://www.s1.umbraco.io/).

### Is Denial of Service (DDoS) testing allowed on my Umbraco Cloud site?

No, DDoS attacks are strictly prohibited on Umbraco Cloud sites.

### Can Umbraco Cloud support my website?

Umbraco Cloud’s ability to support your website depends on different factors, such as visitor volume and media storage requirements.

Performance needs vary by website based on its design and configuration. We recommend conducting a load test to determine if Umbraco Cloud can handle your specific website. This test simulates real-world traffic to assess the computational power and resources your site needs.

You can use tools like [LoadNinja](https://loadninja.com/) to run these tests and understand your website’s requirements.

### Is load testing allowed on my Umbraco Cloud site?

It is recommended to discuss the load test plan with Support before proceeding. Contact Support via the chat button at the bottom right of the [Umbraco Cloud portal](https://www.s1.umbraco.io/).

## Security and Encryption

Can't find an answer to your question? Many security-related topics are covered in the [Security](../../build-and-customize-your-solution/set-up-your-project/security/) article.

### Does Umbraco Cloud support TLS/HTTPS?

Yes. Umbraco Cloud provides automatic Transport Layer Security (TLS)/HTTPS certificates for **all hostnames** added to a project's environment. These certificates, issued by Cloudflare, are valid for 90 days and automatically renewed as long as the hostname remains active.

### Does Umbraco Cloud support custom certificates?

Yes. Professional and Enterprise Plans allow the use of custom certificates for custom hostnames, replacing the default certificates provided by Umbraco Cloud.

Learn more about how to use your own certificates in the [Custom certificates](../../go-live/manage-hostnames/security-certificates.md) article.

### Does Umbraco Cloud support HTTP/2?

By default, Umbraco Cloud supports HTTP/2.

### Why is there an ARRAffinity cookie on my site that isn't sent over HTTPS? Is this a security risk?

No, this is not a security risk. The ARRAffinity cookie is set by the load balancer (LB) to track which server the site is on. It is a built-in feature of Azure App Service and is only useful when scaling to multiple servers. Since Umbraco Cloud does not scale sites across multiple servers, this cookie remains unused.

Learn more in our [Security](../../build-and-customize-your-solution/set-up-your-project/security/README.md#cookies-and-security) article.

### Can wildcard, EV, DV, or OV certificates be used on Umbraco Cloud?

Yes, any valid certificate can be used on Umbraco Cloud.

### Why do I see a "Your connection is not private" warning with a certificate for \*.umbraco.io?

This warning appears when domain bindings are not set up correctly. Check bindings in the [Cloud Portal](https://www.s1.umbraco.io) under the **Manage hostnames** section.

### Can backoffice access be restricted using IP filtering?

Yes. IP filtering can be added to control access. However, Umbraco Deploy must still communicate between environments, and the site should remain accessible locally.

Learn more and how to set it up in the [Security](../../build-and-customize-your-solution/set-up-your-project/security/README.md#deny-specific-ips-from-accessing-your-website) article.

### Does Umbraco Cloud use Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) for databases?

Yes, TDE is enabled by default for sites created after May 2, 2017. For older sites, this feature can be enabled upon request.

## Building and Deploying

### Can a shared SQL Server be used for a development team instead of the SQL/LocalDb database created by Umbraco Cloud?

No, a shared database should not be used. Umbraco Cloud is designed so each team member can safely make changes locally and push them to the Cloud environment. Other developers can do the same, allowing changes to be tested in a structured way. Once changes are confirmed, developers can pull updates and continue working on new features.

Using a shared database can cause two major issues:

1. [Umbraco's flexible load balancing](https://docs.umbraco.com/umbraco-cms/fundamentals/setup/server-setup/load-balancing) automatically activates when multiple developers share a database. Without proper load balancing setup, changes made by one developer may not be visible to others, leading to potential data overwrites.
2. The deployment engine (Umbraco Deploy) is not designed for shared databases. Local sites may quickly fall out of sync, causing errors and mismatches when changes are pushed to the Cloud instance.

### Can custom .NET code be used?

Yes, custom .NET assemblies can be used in Umbraco implementations.

Umbraco Cloud sites run on IIS 8.5, so most configurations that work on IIS will work on Umbraco Cloud. However, components that require server installation are not supported. If the component can be deployed in the bin folder, it should generally work.

Umbraco Cloud operates similarly to Azure Web Apps. If a solution runs on Azure Web Apps, it should work on Umbraco Cloud.

### Can custom DLLs be added to extend the Umbraco Backoffice?

Yes, Umbraco Cloud projects function like standard Umbraco websites, with multiple environments and deployment options for code and content.

The best way to add custom code (templates, `.cs` files, packages, DLLs, etc.) is to run the site locally using Git.

### Can custom tables be added to the Umbraco Cloud database?

Yes, custom tables can be created in the database. Connection strings for different environments are available on the **Connection Details** page in the **Settings** menu.

Custom tables and data do not automatically replicate across Cloud environments. Consider using Umbraco Migrations and the PetaPoco data layer to automate deployment of custom data.

### Are WebSockets supported?

Yes, WebSockets are enabled on all sites.

### Why are deletions not applied when deploying to the next environment?

When content, media, or schema is deleted in one environment, the deletion is not automatically applied when deploying to another environment.

This is intentional behavior.

Only files are deleted—database entries remain to prevent accidental data loss in Live/Production environments.

## Package Support

### Does Umbraco Cloud support package "X"?

Umbraco Cloud runs on Azure App Service Plans, a standard platform for hosting web applications. Most packages that work in local development or on other hosting platforms will also work on Umbraco Cloud.

The main exception is packages that store custom data in the Umbraco database. Most packages either extend functionality without storing data or use existing Umbraco services for storage.

If a package does save data in custom database tables, it will still function on Umbraco Cloud. However, unless the package developer has added support for data transfers, saved information will not move between environments.

This may not be an issue for packages designed to work within a single environment. For example, [Umbraco Workflow](https://docs.umbraco.com/umbraco-workflow/), which typically runs on staging or production. However, if you need to move data between environments (for example, from staging to production or for local debugging), check whether the package supports this.

If data transfer between environments is not working, contact the package developer to ask about support.

### How can I make my package support Umbraco Cloud?

Most packages work on Umbraco Cloud without modification. However, if a package saves data in custom database tables, an extra step is needed for seamless data transfer between environments.

Umbraco Cloud uses [Umbraco Deploy](https://docs.umbraco.com/umbraco-deploy/) to transfer Umbraco schema (for example, document types) and content (for example, media, pages) between environments. To support custom data transfer, package developers must create a **Deploy Connector**, which tells Umbraco Deploy how to handle the package’s data.

#### Key challenges when handling custom data

1. **ID Mismatches** – If a package references an integer ID (for example, a content node with ID `1023`), the same content in another environment may have a different ID (for example, `1039`). The Deploy Connector must map IDs correctly.
2. **Missing Dependencies** – If a package references a content item (`1023`) that does not exist in the target environment, deployment errors may occur.

#### Resources for building a Deploy Connector

* [Umbraco Commerce Deploy](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.Commerce.Deploy) - An open-source example of Connectors.
* [Umbraco Deploy Contrib](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.Deploy.Contrib/) – Pre-installed on all Cloud sites and is updated regularly.
* [Extending Umbraco Deploy Documentation](https://docs.umbraco.com/umbraco-deploy/extending) - Step-by-step guide on building a Deploy Connector.
