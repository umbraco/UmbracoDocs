# Key Features and Benefits of Using Umbraco Cloud

Umbraco Cloud is a fully managed, scalable platform built to simplify and enhance the experience of building, deploying, and maintaining Umbraco websites.

Umbraco Cloud enables developers, agencies, and enterprise teams to work faster, collaborate easily, and maintain security using modern best practices.

This article highlights the most valuable features and benefits of Umbraco Cloud.

## Fully Managed Hosting on Microsoft Azure

Umbraco Cloud hosts your projects on trusted Microsoft Azure infrastructure, ensuring:

* High availability and performance
* Data privacy and security
* Azure-backed reliability and global scalability

## Smooth Deployments & Built-In CI/CD Workflows

Deploy faster and safer with a modern, built-in developer experience:

* Git-based deployments with environment-aware configuration
* Content and media transfers/restores between environments
* Built-in CI/CD pipeline support for GitHub Actions and Azure DevOps

For more information, see the [Deployment](../../build-and-customize-your-solution/handle-deployments-and-environments/deployment/), [CI/CD on Umbraco Cloud](../../build-and-customize-your-solution/handle-deployments-and-environments/umbraco-cicd/), and [GitHub Actions](../../build-and-customize-your-solution/handle-deployments-and-environments/umbraco-cicd/samplecicdpipeline/github-actions.md) articles.

## Faster Project Setup with Baselines

Umbraco Baselines allows you to use a base project as a template for creating more projects. This is ideal if you're planning on building multiple similar websites. For more information, see the [Baselines](../../begin-your-cloud-journey/creating-a-cloud-project/baselines.md) articles.

## Automated Upgrades and Hotfixes

Stay secure and up to date with automated CMS upgrades, including:

* Automatic minor and patch updates
* Security fixes and latest feature rollouts
* Upgrade notifications and version history

For more information, see the [Product Upgrades](../../optimize-and-maintain-your-site/manage-product-upgrades/product-upgrades/) article.

## Security by Default

Umbraco Cloud includes multiple layers of security so your team doesn’t have to manage patches or infrastructure hardening manually:

* HTTPS is enabled by default
* Optional basic authentication per environment
* Environment-specific hostname settings
* Secrets management
* Support for external login providers (for example, Microsoft Entra ID, Auth0, Google, and so on)

For more information, see the [Security](../../build-and-customize-your-solution/set-up-your-project/security/) article.

## Multi-Environment Workflow

Every project comes with mainline and flexible environments (based on the plan), so you can:

* Deploy between mainline and flexible environments&#x20;
* Test safely before going live

For more information, read the [Environments](../../begin-your-cloud-journey/project-features/environments.md) and [Flexible Environments](../../begin-your-cloud-journey/project-features/flexible-environments.md) articles.

## Insights and Performance Monitoring

Get visibility into site health and performance:

* Application Insights for performance and logging
* Usage statistics via the Cloud Portal
* Alerts on downtime or performance issues

For more information, see the [Application Insights](../../expand-your-projects-capabilities/external-services/application-insights.md) article.

## Unlimited Team Collaboration

Umbraco Cloud is designed for modern teams and agencies:

* Role-based permissions
