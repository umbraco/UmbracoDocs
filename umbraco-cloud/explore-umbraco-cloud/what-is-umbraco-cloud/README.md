# What is Umbraco Cloud?

Umbraco Cloud is a fully managed, flexible, and scalable way to build and host Umbraco websites, all in one place. Built on the open-source Umbraco CMS and hosted on Microsoft Azure, it provides everything developers and teams need for fast, secure digital experiences.

Umbraco Cloud takes care of installation, infrastructure, and security. You will also get the tools to work with your project in the Cloud or locally. Local development starts with cloning the project down to your PC or Linux/macOS.

When you are ready to show your work to the world, Umbraco Cloud provides a safe deployment mechanism that lets you publish to the web. When you have changes or updates to your site, Umbraco Cloud follows the process of moving, testing, and deploying your changes to your public site.

## Why Use Umbraco Cloud?

* Fully managed hosting: Hosted on Microsoft Azure with automatic backups, global Content Delivery Network (CDN), HTTPS, and scaling built in.
* Out-of-the-box DevOps: Use Git-based workflows, built-in CI/CD, and structured environments (Development, Staging, Live) to deliver with confidence.
* Seamless collaboration: Invite team members, manage access, and deploy content and code with ease, all from Cloud Portal.
* Security and reliability: Backed by secure infrastructure, automated Transport Layer Security (TLS), point-in-time restores, and Cloudflare protection for performance and safety.
