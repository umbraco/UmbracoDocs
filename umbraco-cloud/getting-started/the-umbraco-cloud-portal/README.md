# The Cloud Portal

The Umbraco Cloud Portal helps you manage your Umbraco Cloud project. From here, you can view and manage all your Cloud projects in one place.

## Umbraco Cloud Portal Overview

When you log in to the [Umbraco Cloud Portal](https://www.s1.umbraco.io/home/login/), the projects dashboard gives an overview of all your Umbraco Cloud projects. Here, you can view all the projects you've created or have been added to as a team member.

You can see the project's environments, usage for each project, and which plans it is on. You can also see whether it is a baseline or baseline-child project.

In the top-right corner of the Umbraco Cloud Portal, you will find:

* **Create New Project** - Allows you to create more projects using the plan you wish and a project will be ready for you within a few minutes.
* **Notifications** - You can also see notifications for your different projects. For example: if your project has been automatically updated or if an upgrade has failed.
* **Profile** - Manage projects, subscriptions, pending invites, organization information, profile details, view release notes, and log out of the portal.

## Project Groups

### Settings

In the right-side corner of the Umbraco Cloud Portal, you can enable **Show environments** and **Show usage** of the project from the **Settings** option.

### Projects

Managing your projects has been simplified with Umbraco Cloud. By navigating to a specific project, you can quickly view the environments within your project.

* **Project Name:** includes options to **Create environments** or **Invite User**.
* **Environment Name:** offers options to **Restart** the environment, view **History**, **Logs**, **Error Logs**, **Clone project**, **Delete** project.
* **Links:** Provides access to **View Website** (frontend), **Backoffice**, **Power Tools (Kudu)**, and **Clone project**.
* **Change Details:** Allows you to view change details.

To manage the environments in your project, click **Create Environments** to add or remove environments as needed. For more information on how the number of environments varies by plan, refer to the [Project Overview](../project-overview.md) article.

Additionally, changes are deployed from one Cloud environment to another from the project view. Find out more in the [Cloud-to-Cloud](../../deployment/cloud-to-cloud.md) article.

In the [Settings](../../set-up/project-settings/) section, you will find more options to configure your project.
