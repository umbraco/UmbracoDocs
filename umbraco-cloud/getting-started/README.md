# What is Umbraco Cloud?

Umbraco Cloud is our hosting option for your favorite Umbraco CMS. Built on the Microsoft Azure Cloud and encompassing web standard approaches, Umbraco Cloud is familiar to Umbraco's new and old users. With Umbraco Cloud, there are no limits to what you can accomplish. Anything you can do with Umbraco and web technology you can do with Umbraco Cloud.

Umbraco Cloud takes care of installation, infrastructure, and security. You will also get the tools to work with your project in the Cloud or locally. Local development starts with cloning the project down to your PC or Mac.

When you are ready to show your work to the world, Umbraco Cloud provides a safe deployment mechanism that lets you publish to the web. When you have changes or updates to your site, Umbraco Cloud follows the process of moving, testing, and deploying your changes to your public site.

## Umbraco Cloud Project

## Different ways to start an Umbraco Cloud project

You might not always want to start your Umbraco Cloud project with a clean slate. Perhaps you have an already existing site that you want to move on to the Cloud. For this purpose, we've created a [Migration guide](migrate-existing-site/) that you can follow to successfully move your project to Umbraco Cloud.

If you are creating several similar projects, we have a feature called [Baselines](baselines/) that lets you create new projects based on existing Umbraco Cloud projects.
