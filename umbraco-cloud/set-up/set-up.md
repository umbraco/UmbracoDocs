# Set Up

Now that you've created a project, there are a few things you may want to do to make working with your project easier. As you get ready to launch your live site, there are some other considerations to consider as well.

Most of the set up can be accomplished by using the options from your project's **Settings** drop-down. Some of the setups apply to all your projects, so you'll make these updates from your **Profile** section.
