## How to change ownership of subscriptions and projects

You might find yourself in a situation where you will need to change the ownerships of subscriptions or projects. This can be done in the following ways:

### Subscriptions

Changing subscription ownership is not something you can do by yourself. You will need to reach out to our **Support Team** and they will do it for you.

Whoever is taking over a subscription will need to have an existing account on umbraco.com. If they do not have an account, they can register [here](https://shop.umbraco.com/profile/register).

When you have registered your user. You will need to log in to your [profile](https://shop.umbraco.com/profile/edit-your-details/) and fill out the following details under the invoicing information section. Please make sure you fill out the following:

* Company Name
* Address
* Country
* VAT number (if within the EU)

{% hint style="info" %}
The owner of the subscription must reach out when changing the owner.
{% endhint %}

### Projects

Handing over a project to someone else can be done by adding them to the project as a [Team Member](../project-settings/team-members/) from the portal. Make sure that you grant them admin rights when adding them so they have full control over the project. When they have been added they can remove you from the project.

{% hint style="info" %}
Remember to change the [technical contact details](../project-settings/team-members/technical-contact.md) on the project to the new owner, as Umbraco will send updates such as automated upgrade notifications to whoever is listed under technical contact.

You can change the technical contact details under the **Edit team** section in the Backoffice.
