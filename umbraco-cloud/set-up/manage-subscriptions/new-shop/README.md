## Payment and Invoices

On Umbraco Cloud, we are sending out one single invoice with all the projects that you are paying for via email every month.

You can view the invoices for your projects under your organization in the Payment History section. From here you can see the following for each invoice:

* The payment number
* The total amount paid
* When the invoice was created
* The due date
* The status of the invoice

It is also possible to download the invoice. When downloading an invoice for a given month, the invoice will contain all the projects that you were paying for during the month.
