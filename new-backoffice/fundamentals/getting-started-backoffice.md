Whether you're building Umbraco packages or implementing backoffice extensions, you can find resources for development here.

While [Lit](https://lit.dev/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) have been used for building the new backoffice, developers are free to use any framework and libraries of their choice to implement the backoffice extensions.

In this section of the documentation, we'll provide an overview of the different ways you can keep up with the development of the Backoffice.

## Backoffice Library on Storybook

Documentation for the new Backoffice is still in the early days. For now, you can find documentation for working with and using the new backoffice components on the [**Backoffice Library on Storybook**](https://apidocs.umbraco.com/v14/ui/).
