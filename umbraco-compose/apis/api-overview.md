# API Overview

The following APIs are available for managing and for getting content into and out of your Umbraco Compose project.

The [Management API](management/) is where you can administrate all non-content aspects of your project. From here you can manage environments, user permissions, content type schemas, and more.

The [Ingestion API](ingestion/) is where content enters the platform.

The [GraphQL delivery API](graphql/) is how you query content from the platform.
