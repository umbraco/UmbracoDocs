# Submit Feedback

There are different ways to submit feedback on the Umbraco Documentation, whether it's about a single article or the platform as a whole. Your input helps us improve and prioritize what matters most to the community.

This article gives you an overview of the different feedback channels and how to use them.

## Submit Feedback on an Article

On the right-hand side of every article, you'll find an option to submit feedback directly related to that article.

* An article contains outdated or incorrect information, and you don't have time or knowledge to submit a PR.
* You would like to propose a new section or discuss improvements to existing documentation.
