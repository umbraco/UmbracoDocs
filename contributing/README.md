### Documentation

First off, there's a lot of documentation, and it's not always easy to keep it updated or know if we covered all the details you need to know to follow them. We would love your help to verify the documentation. That is, to follow the docs to the letter and see if youâ€™re successful or missing anything.

Find detailed instructions on [how to contribute to the docs directly on the documentation site](documentation/getting-started/). Here, we have outlined the steps involved with testing and checking the articles against our style guide. In the same article, you can also learn much more about the rules weâ€™re checking the docs against.

Head on over to [the contributing guide for Documentation](documentation/getting-started/) for the full details.

### Umbraco CMS

There are plenty of [up-for-grabs issues](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco-CMS/issues?q=is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3Acommunity%2Fup-for-grabs+) to look at - a great starting point if youâ€™re not quite sure where to start.

We're also happy for you to work on translations or other problems you might know of that are not on the issue tracker yet.

Head on over to [the contributing guide for Umbraco-CMS](umbraco-cms/contributing.md) for the full details.

### UI Library

The UI library contains all the UI elements for the backoffice. These are self-contained components that can be used in any project that needs a UI.
