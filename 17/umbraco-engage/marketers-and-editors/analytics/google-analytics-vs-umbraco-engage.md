# Google Analytics vs Umbraco Engage

You can see a difference in statistics (Pageviews, Visitors, etc.) between Google Analytics and Umbraco Engage.

Umbraco Engage will collect page views regardless of whether Google Analytics (GA) is blocked or cookies are not accepted. Expect approximately 10%-25% more pageviews in Umbraco Engage compared to Google Analytics, which is considered normal. This depends on the website audience with the current available information.
