# Reporting

The data is visualized in two parts in Umbraco:

* The Umbraco Engage section gives an overview of all data that is recorded. The data is visualized for the entire installation and all pages and visitors. These reports give a perfect overview on a top level.
* For more detailed reports on an individual page (Umbraco node), you can go to the Analytics [Content app](../../../marketers-and-editors/introduction/content-apps.md).

## Source of data

All the data for the reports are generated nightly at 4:00 AM (configurable). During this process all the relational data is turned into a star scheme for quick reporting in the different Umbraco Engage sections.&#x20;
