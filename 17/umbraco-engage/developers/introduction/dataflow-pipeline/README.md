  The Umbraco Engage package is all about data, data, and more data. To make the
  most out of this data and do it the most efficient way we have four different
  stages where the data goes to.

# Dataflow Pipeline

1. [Data collection](data-collection.md): This is where the visitor data is collected and stored for a moment in the memory of the server.
2. [Data storage](data-storage.md): This is where the data from memory goes to the database.
3. [Data processing](data-parsing.md): The data is processed at a later moment to make it more efficient and normalized
4. [Data reporting](reporting.md): Finally the data is reported within Umbraco Engage

The concept of this Dataflow is the most important concept to grasp when using Umbraco Engage.
