# Settings

In this section, you can find information about configuring different parts of Umbraco Engage.

## **Goals Configuration**

Users can set goals to track important actions or A/B test results. These goals help monitor performance and effectiveness.

You can also find an article on [setting up custom Goal Scoring](custom-goals-scoring.md).

## [Configuration](configuration.md)

While most configurations and settings will be visible in the Umbraco backoffice, they can only be changed in the `appSettings.json` configuration file. The configuration file article provides an overview of the available settings.

## **Permissions**

Administrators can assign different permissions to control access to marketing and content apps, based on user roles or Document Types.

These settings allow users to manage and fine-tune their marketing efforts, ensuring data accuracy and access control.
