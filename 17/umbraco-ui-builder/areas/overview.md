# Areas

Umbraco UI Builder can be integrated into different areas of the Umbraco Backoffice. Before you start managing content, it is essential to decide which area best suits the presentation of your data. Each area offers unique features for displaying and interacting with content.

Once you have identified the most appropriate area, you can proceed with configuring it to suit your needs.

## Key Areas for Integration

- [Sections](sections.md): The Sections area allows you to organize your content in a structured layout, enabling users to navigate different parts of the backoffice.
- [Dashboards](dashboards.md): The Dashboards area is ideal for creating custom views that provide quick access to key information and statistics.
- [Context Apps](context-apps.md): Context Apps provide contextual tools and information based on the specific content a user is working with.

Selecting the correct area is essential to ensure your UI is both functional and user-friendly. Consider the nature of your content and the tasks users need to perform when deciding which area to use.
