# Overview

Cards provide an API to display summary information in a card-based format, which is useful for displaying key metrics about a collection.

Cards can be defined in two ways:

{% content-ref url="count-cards.md" %}
[count-cards.md](count-cards.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="custom-cards.md" %}
[custom-cards.md](custom-cards.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
