If you have a custom data store that you want to manage within Umbraco, you can use Umbraco UI Builder. With few lines of code, you can configure a custom administration UI, and reuse many core components with a consistent look and feel.

With Umbraco UI Builder, custom backoffice integrations can now be set up in minutes rather than days.
