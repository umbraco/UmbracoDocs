# Implementing a Checkout Flow

When it comes to implementing a checkout in Umbraco Commerce, there are two options available to you.

## [Using the Umbraco.Commerce.Checkout Drop-in Checkout Flow](https://docs.umbraco.com/umbraco-commerce-packages/checkout/checkout)

The [Umbraco.Commerce.Checkout](https://docs.umbraco.com/umbraco-commerce-packages/checkout/checkout) add-on is a great starting point for most stores. It provides a ready-to-use checkout experience.

For details on how to install and configure the `Umbraco.Commerce.Checkout` add-on, see the [Umbraco.Commerce.Checkout](https://docs.umbraco.com/umbraco-commerce-packages/checkout/checkout) documentation.

## Creating a Custom Shopping Cart

If you need a more custom checkout experience, you can build your own checkout flow using the Umbraco Commerce API. This approach gives you full control over the checkout experience, allowing you to tailor it to your specific requirements.

For details on how to build a custom checkout flow, see the [Creating a Custom Checkout Flow](custom-checkout.md) article.
