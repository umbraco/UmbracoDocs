# Installation

The first thing you need to do is set up an Umbraco site with Umbraco Commerce installed.

## Prerequisites

To follow this tutorial, you'll need the following:

* Umbraco.CMS version 15.1.0+
* Umbraco.Commerce version 15.0.0
* SQL Database (LocalDB or any SQL server)
* Visual Studio or your preferred IDE
* [Umraco CMS Requirements](../../../umbraco-cms/fundamentals/setup/requirements.md)

## Setup your Umbraco Project

To set up your Umbraco project, see the [Installation](../../../umbraco-cms/fundamentals/setup/install/README.md) article.

## Installing Umbraco Commerce

Once your Umbraco site is up and running, you can install the [Umbraco Commerce package](../../getting-started/install.md).
