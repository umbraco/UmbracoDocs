# User Interface

The Umbraco Commerce UI consists of a number of key areas, split over three sections within the Umbraco backoffice:

* **Settings** for managing the different store settings.
* **Commerce** for managing store-related content (orders, discounts, etc).
* **Content** for managing the Umbraco Commerce products.

## Settings Section

The **Settings** section is where the configuration of all Store settings is managed. From here you can manage how the Store works as well as what options will be available within the Store.

The UI for the **Settings** section consists of a Tree which lists all available Stores and their key areas available for configuration. It also contains a right-hand editor panel. This can either act as an editor interface or as a list view interface for listing items within that given configuration area.
