# Migrate custom Payment Providers

Throughout the following steps, we will migrate custom payment providers used for Umbraco Commerce into Umbraco Commerce.

1. Remove any installed Umbraco Commerce packages

```bash
dotnet remove package Umbraco.Commerce.Core
```

2. Install the `Umbraco.Commerce` packages for the payment providers.

```bash
dotnet add package Umbraco.Commerce.Core
```

3. Update any namespace references.
4. Update project framework to `net7.0`.

The final step in the migration is to update all abstract async methods exposed by the base class. It needs to be updated to accept an additional `CancellationToken cancellationToken = default` parameter as the final method argument. Your Integrated Development Environment (IDE) should provide feedback on all the methods that have been updated.
