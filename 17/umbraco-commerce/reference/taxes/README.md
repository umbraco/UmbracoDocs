# Taxes

Umbraco Commerce offers two different tax calculation method configurations for calculating an order's tax amounts.

### [Fixed Tax Rates](./fixed-tax-rates.md)

This option allows you to define a single fixed tax rate to apply for all products of the same type shipped to the same country. This option is useful for countries that have a fixed tax rate (the norm in EU countries).

### [Calculated Tax Rates](./calculated-tax-rates.md)

This option allows you to dynamically calculate the tax obligations of an order by using third-party calculation platforms. This complex option is useful for countries with different tax rates for different product types or regions within the country (the norm in the US).
