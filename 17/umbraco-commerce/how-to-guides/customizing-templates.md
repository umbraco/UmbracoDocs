# Customizing Templates

Umbraco Commerce provides support for customizing templates for emails, prints, and exports. This allows you to tailor the outputs of your e-commerce solution to meet specific branding or functional requirements.

## Accessing the Default Built-in Templates

The default templates for email, print, and export are embedded in Razor Class Libraries (RCLs) in Umbraco Commerce. To customize these templates, you can extract them and use them as a starting point.

Download the custom templates and place them in `/Views/Partials/Commerce/Email/`.
