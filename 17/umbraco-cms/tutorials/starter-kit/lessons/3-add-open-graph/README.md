# Add Open Graph

With a few steps, we can add Open Graph to our pages.

## Outcome

Open Graph support will be added to the Homepage and Blog posts. It will be the minimum implementation of Open Graph containing the sites' `title`, `type`, `URL`, and `image`.

## Takeaway

You will learn:

* How to create a reusable set of properties (called Document Type compositions)
* Add features based on where the composition is implemented
* Get the URL for content items and media items
