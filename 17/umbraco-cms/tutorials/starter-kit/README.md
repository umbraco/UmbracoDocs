* Show the content creation and editing capabilities in Umbraco from a content editor's point of view.
* Learn how to set up Umbraco by exploring the starter kit.
* Enhance the Starter Kit by following the lessons provided. The lessons aim to give you a good understanding of how you can tailor the editing experience and add features to an Umbraco site.
