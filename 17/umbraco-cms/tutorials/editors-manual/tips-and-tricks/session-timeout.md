# Session Timeout

Umbraco is set up to automatically log a user out if they have been inactive for over 20 minutes. Don't worry if you are logged out of Umbraco. Log back in using your credentials and continue editing.

## Session Timeout Configuration for Developers

The session timeout can be configured in Umbraco's `appsettings.json` file. You can modify the [`Timeout`](https://docs.umbraco.com/umbraco-cms/reference/configuration/globalsettings#timeout)  setting to extend or reduce the timeout duration based on your site's needs.
