# Version Management

Umbraco allows you to work with multiple versions of the same page. All previously saved pages are stored in a version history list. In this section, you will find information on how to compare versions or roll back different versions of content:

  - [Comparing Versions](comparing-versions.md)

  - [Rollback to a Previous Version](rollback-to-a-previous-version.md)
