# Sorting Pages

The pages in Umbraco are placed in the tree structure according to a predefined sort order. The most recently created page is placed at the bottom of the tree structure. You can change the order of the pages by using the **Sort** function.

You can sort pages in two ways:

## Option 1

1. Go to **Content**.
2. Navigate to the parent node whose child nodes you wish to sort.
3. Click **...** next to the page you wish to sort.
4. Select **Sort children of**.
