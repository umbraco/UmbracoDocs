# Editing Existing Content

## Content Within the Tree View

When you are looking to edit content, locate the _**page**_ you want to edit in the Content tree on the left-side of the screen.

To edit existing content, follow these steps:

3. Edit the contents of the page.
4. Click **Save** to save the edits without publishing it.
5. Click **Save and preview** to preview the changes.
6. Click **Save and publish** to publish the changes. For more information, see the [Save and Publishing Pages](creating-saving-and-publishing-content.md#saving-and-publishing-pages) article.

## View Page Layout

By default, you can view Page layouts in two ways:

1.  **List**

    When you enable Collection on a page, there will be no standard tree view for that page. Clicking on the parent page displays the child pages in a list.

2.  **Grid**

    You can switch between list and grid view by clicking the ![layout](../../../.gitbook/assets/layout.png) icon in the top-right of the screen:

3. Go to the **Structure** tab.
4. Click **Configure as a Collection** in the Collections field.
5. Select **List View - Content**.
6.  Click **Save**.
