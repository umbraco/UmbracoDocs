  This section explains how the concept of infinite editing using the Sidebar in
  the Umbraco backoffice works.

# Sidebar

{% hint style="info" %}
Sidebar was previously called Infinite editor.
{% endhint %}

This feature enables you to work with your content without losing the context of what you are doing.

Document Types are in different sections than content but the sidebar enables you to make changes to them directly from the content you are editing.

In the example showcased above, new options are being added to a Data Type, without losing the context of the content. The example also shows how you can edit images, without being sent to the 'Media' section.

## Customize

The sidebar is a feature that comes out of the box with Umbraco. The feature can be customized, which enables you as a developer to improve the workflow for your editors.
