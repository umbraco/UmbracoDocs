## Test the Release Candidate

Ensure you meet the prerequisites and move on to the installation steps outlined below.

### Prerequisites

* The latest [.NET SDK 10.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/10.0).

### Install the Release Candidate

The [release candidate is available on NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Umbraco.Templates/17.0.0-beta).

1. Install the Umbraco dotnet template for the Release Candidate.

```cmd
dotnet new install Umbraco.Templates::17.0.0-beta
```

2. Create a new Umbraco project.

```cmd
dotnet new umbraco -n MyCustomUmbracoProject
```

3. Navigate to the newly created folder.

```cmd
cd MyCustomUmbracoProject
```

4. Build and run the project.

```cmd
dotnet build
dotnet run
```

This will boot the project, and write the log to the console. The website is now running on your local machine and will be available on the ports written in the console.

{% hint style="info" %}
Alternatively, you can install and run the Umbraco project using your favorite IDE (Integrated Development Environment).
{% endhint %}
