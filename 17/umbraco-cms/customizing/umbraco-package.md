# Umbraco Package

A Package is declared via an Umbraco Package JSON file. This describes the Package and declares one or more UI Extensions. The Package declaration is a JSON file that is stored in the `App_Plugins/{YourPackageName}` folder. The file is named `umbraco-package.json`.

## Sample

Here is a sample package. It should be stored in a folder in `App_Plugins/{YourPackageName}`, with the name `umbraco-package.json`. In this example, the package name is `SirTrevor` and is a text box property Data Type.

{% hint style="info" %}
Before Umbraco 14, a package was declared in a `package.manifest` file instead of `umbraco-package.json`. The old format is no longer supported, but you can migrate the contents to the new format.
{% endhint %}

{% code title="umbraco-package.json" lineNumbers="true" %}
```json
{
    "id": "My.Nuget.Package",
    "name": "Sir Trevor",
    "version": "1.0.0-beta",
    "extensions": [
        {
            "type": "propertyEditorUi",
            "alias": "Sir.Trevor",
            "name": "Sir Trevor Property Editor UI",
            "element": "/App_Plugins/SirTrevor/SirTrevor.js",
            "meta": {
                "label": "Sir Trevor",
                "propertyEditorSchemaAlias": "Umbraco.TextBox",
                "icon": "icon-code",
                "group": "Pickers"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```
{% endcode %}

## Root fields

The `umbraco-package` accepts these fields:

```json
{
    "id": "",
    "name": "",
    "version": "",
    "allowTelemetry": true,
    "allowPublicAccess": false,
    "importmap": {
        "imports": {
            "": ""
        },
        "scopes": {
            "": ""
        }
    },
    "extensions": []
}
```

### Id

The unique identifier for your package. This is used to identify your package and should be unique to your package. If you are creating a package that is distributed via NuGet, you should use the NuGet package ID as the ID for your package.

### Name

Allows you to specify a friendly name for your package that will be used for telemetry. If no name is specified the name of the folder will be used instead.

### Version

The version of your package, if this is not specified there will be no version-specific information for your package. This is used for telemetry and to help users understand what version of your package they are using. It is also used for package migrations. The version should follow the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) format.

### Allow Telemetry

With this field, you can control the telemetry of this package, this will provide Umbraco with the knowledge of how many installations use this package.

The default is `true`.

Also known as: `allowPackageTelemetry`

### Allow Public Access

This field is used to allow public access to the package. If set to `true`, the package will be available for anonymous usage, for example on the login screen. If set to `false`, the package will only be available to logged-in users.

The default is `false`.

### Importmap

The `importmap` field is an object that contains two properties: `imports` and `scopes`. This is used to define the import map for the package. The `imports` property is an object that contains the import map for the package. The `scopes` property is an object that contains the scopes for the package.

**Example**

This example shows how to define an import map for a module exported by a package:

{% code title="umbraco-package.json" lineNumbers="true" %}
```json
{
    "importmap": {
        "imports": {
            "mypackage/services": "/App_Plugins/MyPackage/services/index.js",
        }
    }
}
```
{% endcode %}

The `imports` object contains the import map for the package. The key is the specifier for the module that is being imported, and the value is the URL of the module.

This allows developers to consume modules that are exported by a package without having to know the exact path to the module:

{% code title="index.js" %}
```javascript
import { MyService } from 'mypackage/services';
```
{% endcode %}

Umbraco supports the current specification of the property as outlined on MDN Web Documentation: [importmap](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script/type/importmap).

### Extensions

The `extensions` field is an array of Extension Manifest objects. Each object describes a single client extension.

Read more about Extension Types in the Backoffice to get a better understanding of the different types of extensions:

{% content-ref url="extending-overview/extension-types/README.md#full-list-of-extension-types" %}
[extending-overview/extension-types/README.md#full-list-of-extension-types](extending-overview/extension-types/README.md#full-list-of-extension-types)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## Package Manifest IntelliSense

Make your IDE be aware about the opportunities of the `umbraco-package.json` by adding a JSON schema. This gives your code editor abilities to autocomplete and knowledge about the format. This helps to avoid mistakes or errors when editing the `umbraco-package.json` file.

### Adding inline schema

Editors like Visual Studio can use the `$schema` notation in your file.

```json
{
    "$schema": "../../umbraco-package-schema.json",
    "name": ""
}
```

Hover over any of the properties to see the description of the property. You can also use the `Ctrl + Space` (Windows/Linux) or `CMD + Space` (macOS) shortcut to see the available properties.

## Load Package Manifest files

Umbraco scans the `App_Plugins` folder for `umbraco-package.json` files **two levels deep**. When found, the packages are loaded into the system.

You may need to restart the application, if you add a new file or modify an existing manifest:

If the runtime mode is `Production`, the manifests are cached for 30 days or until the application is restarted to improve performance. In other runtime modes, the cache is cleared every 10 seconds.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can implement the interface [IPackageManifestReader](https://apidocs.umbraco.com/v15/csharp/api/Umbraco.Cms.Infrastructure.Manifest.IPackageManifestReader.html) to provide your own package manifest reader. This can be useful if you want to load package manifests from a different location or source.
{% endhint %}

## Razor Class Library

Umbraco also supports [Razor Class Library (RCL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/razor-pages/ui-class?view=aspnetcore-8.0\&tabs=visual-studio#create-an-rcl-with-static-assets) projects that contain static web assets. The `umbraco-package.json` file can be placed in the `wwwroot` folder of the RCL project. The package will be loaded when the RCL is referenced by the main project. You must map the web path to `App_Plugins` in your `.csproj` file:

{% code title="MyProject.Assets.csproj" %}
```xml
<PropertyGroup>
    <StaticWebAssetBasePath>App_Plugins/{YourPackageName}</StaticWebAssetBasePath>
</PropertyGroup>
```
{% endcode %}
