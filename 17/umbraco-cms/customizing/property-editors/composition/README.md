A property editor is an editor used to insert content into Umbraco. A Property Editor is composed of two extensions. To form a full Property Editor you will need a:

* [Property Editor Schema](property-editor-schema.md)
* [Property Editor UI](property-editor-ui.md)

A Property Editor UI is utilizing a Property Editor Schema, and you can have multiple Property Editor UIs for one Schema. This means you can find a Schema that solves your needs. You only need to build a Property Editor UI.

* Each Property Editor can have multiple Property Editor UIs.
* Both a Property Editor Schema and Property Editor UI can define the Settings used for their configuration.

### Configuration

* Data Type Settings for a Property Editor or Property Editor UI is defined in the manifests.
* They both use the same format for their settings.
