A Workspace is the editor for a specific entity type. It can either be a view of data or a complex editor with multiple views.

* A workspace is based on an entity type (for example content, media, member, etc.) and a unique string (ex: key).
* Most workspaces hold a draft state of an entity. It is a copy of the entity data that can be modified at runtime and sent to the server to be saved.
* A workspace can be a single view or consist of multiple views.
* A workspace should host a workspace context, with which anything within can communicate.
