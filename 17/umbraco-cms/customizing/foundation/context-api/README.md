# Context API

The Context API enables receiving APIs. Depending on where your code is executed from, it affects which and what instances of APIs can be received. The DOM structure defines the scope of who can gain access to what APIs. This is because the APIs are provided via an element and can then only be consumed by code running on itself or descendant elements.
