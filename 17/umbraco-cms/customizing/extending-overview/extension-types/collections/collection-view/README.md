  Learn how to create a Collection View that defines how data is displayed within a collection in Umbraco.
---

## Purpose
Use a Collection View when you need to:
- Present data in a structured or visual way (for example, table, cards, grid)
- Customize how entity fields are displayed

{% hint style="info" %}
Before creating a Collection View, make sure you are familiar with the [Extension Registry in Umbraco](../../../../customizing/extending-overview/extension-registry/register-extensions.md).
{% endhint %}

## Kinds
There are a couple built-in Collection Views Kinds available in Umbraco, each suited for different display needs. You can also create custom Collection Views if the built-in options do not meet your requirements.

- **[Card View](card.md)**: Displays entities as cards in a grid layout, suitable for visual content.
- **[Reference View](reference.md)**: Displays entities in a list-style layout.
- **[Custom View](custom.md)**: Create your own Collection View from scratch to meet specific requirements.
