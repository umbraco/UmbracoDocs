# Extension Conditions

Extension Manifest Conditions enable you to declare requirements for an Extension before it becomes available.

## Utilizing Conditions in your Manifest

Conditions are referenced via their alias. The Declaration of a Condition is shown in the following example:

```typescript
const manifest = {
    type: 'workspaceView',
    ...
    conditions: [
        {
            alias: 'Umb.Condition.WorkspaceAlias',
            match: 'Umb.Workspace.Document',
        },
    ],
};
```

By declaring a condition the extension will become available only once the condition is permitted.

The example above requires the nearest Workspaces Alias to be equal to `'Umb.Workspace.Document'`.

When declaring multiple conditions all of them must be permitted for the extension to be available.

## Built-in Conditions Types

For a list of available options, see the [Built-in Conditions Types](extension-types/condition.md#built-in-conditions-types) section.

## Condition Configuration

The conditions are defined as an array of condition configurations. Each entry can contain the following properties:

* `alias`- The alias of the condition to utilize.
* `...` - The rest of the properties of the object are specific to the condition configuration.
