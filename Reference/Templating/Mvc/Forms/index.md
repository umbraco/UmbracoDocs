# Creating Forms

Creating an HTML form to submit data with MVC in Umbraco is possible in a few steps.

If you want to create a Form:

1. Using view models, views, controllers, and a handy HtmlHelper extension method called BeginUmbracoForm, see the [Creating Forms](../../../../Fundamentals/Code/Creating-Forms/index.md) article.
2. Using Umbraco Forms, see the [Umbraco Forms Documentation](../../../../Add-ons/UmbracoForms/index.md) article.
