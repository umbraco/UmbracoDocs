If you have a custom data store that you want to content manage from within Umbraco, then you can use Umbraco UI Builder. With some lines of code, you can configure a custom administration UI, and reuse many core components with a consistent look and feel.

With Umbraco UI Builder, custom backoffice integrations can now take a matter of minutes, rather than days.
