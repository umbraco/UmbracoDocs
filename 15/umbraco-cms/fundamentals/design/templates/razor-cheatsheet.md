# Razor Cheatsheet

The Razor Cheatsheet is a collection of common methods used for building templates and views in Umbraco CMS.&#x20;

Get the Umbraco 11 Cheatsheet: [https://umbra.co/razorCheatsheet](https://umbra.co/razorCheatsheet)

You can also find the [cheatsheet on GitHub](https://github.com/umbraco/UmbracoDocs/tree/RazorCheatSheet) where you can give feedback, contribute, or download the template used to _generate_ the sheet.

Use the cheatsheet if you:

* Use Models Builder on your project and
* Use Umbraco 11.

{% hint style="info" %}
Most of the methods in the Umbraco 11 version of the cheatsheet will also work in Umbraco 10 and 9.
