## Cart Cleanup Service

The cart cleanup service is a new background service that periodically cleans up old abandoned carts. This service is off by default, but can be enabled via app settings.

```json
{
    "Umbraco" : {
        "Commerce": {
            "CartCleanupPolicy": {
                "EnableCleanup": true,
                "KeepCartsForDays": 800
            }
        }
    }
}
```

See the [Configuring Cart Cleanup guide](../how-to-guides/configuring-cart-cleanup.md) for more details.

## Order Line Actions

Order line actions are a new UI extension point that lets you register custom buttons to display against each order line of a cart/order.
