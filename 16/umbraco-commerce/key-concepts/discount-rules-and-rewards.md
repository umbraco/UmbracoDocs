# Discount Rules / Rewards

Discounts in Umbraco Commerce are defined using a series of rules and reward builders that let you configure the following:

* When a Discount should apply.
* What the Reward should be for that Discount.

These builders come with a handful of the most common Rules and Rewards that should suit the majority of web stores' needs. When need to create your own Rules or Rewards then these are extendable via a Provider model allowing you to incorporate your own custom logic.

## Discount Rules

There are two types of Discount Rules in Umbraco Commerce:

* **Order Discount Rules**: Determine whether a discount should apply to an Order. Returns a Fulfilled/Unfulfilled status depending on whether the Rule logic has been met.
* **Order Line Discount Rules**: Determine whether a discount should apply to an Order Line within an Order. Returns a Fulfilled/Unfulfilled status depending on whether the Rule logic has been met. Where the status is Fulfilled, a list of all Order Lines that are fulfilled by this Rule is also returned.

### Example: Custom Order Discount Rule Provider

An example of an Order Discount Rule Provider would look something like this:

```csharp
[DiscountRuleProvider("myCustomOrderRule")]
public class MyCustomOrderRuleProvider : OrderDiscountRuleProviderBase<MyCustomOrderRuleProviderSettings>
{
    public override async Task<DiscountRuleResult> ValidateRuleAsync(DiscountRuleContext ctx, MyCustomOrderRuleProviderSettings settings)
    {
        if (/* Some custom logic */)
            return Fulfilled();

        return Unfulfilled();
    }
}

public class MyCustomOrderRuleProviderSettings
{
    [DiscountRuleProviderSetting(Key = "priceType")]
    public OrderPriceType PriceType { get; set; }

    ...
}

```

All Order Discount Rule Providers inherit from a base class `OrderDiscountRuleProviderBase<TSettings>`. `TSettings` is the type of a Plain Old Class Object (POCO) model class representing the Discount Rule Providers settings.

{% hint style="info" %}
See the [Settings Objects](discount-rules-and-rewards.md#settings-objects) section below for more information on Settings objects.
{% endhint %}

The class must be decorated with `DiscountRuleProviderAttribute` which defines the Discount Rule Providers `alias` and `name`, and can also specify a `description` or `icon` to be displayed in the backoffice. The `DiscountRuleProviderAttribute` is also responsible for defining a `labelView` for the Provider.

{% hint style="info" %}
See the [Label views](discount-rules-and-rewards.md#label-views) section below for more information on Label Views.
{% endhint %}

Rule Providers have a `ValidateRule` method that accepts a `DiscountRuleContext` as well as an instance of the Providers `TSettings` settings model. Inside this you can perform your custom logic, returning a `DiscountRuleResult` to notify Umbraco Commerce of the Rule outcome.

If the passed-in context (which contains a reference to the Order) meets the Rule's criteria, then a fulfilled `DiscountRuleResult` can be returned by calling `return Fulfilled();`. Alternatively, if the Order didn't meet the Rules criteria an unfulfilled `DiscountRuleResult` can be returned by calling `return Unfulfilled();`.

### Example: Custom Order Line Discount Rule Provider

An example of an Order Line Discount Rule Provider would look something like this:

```csharp
[DiscountRuleProvider("myCustomOrderLineRule")]
public class MyCustomOrderLineRuleProvider : OrderLineDiscountRuleProviderBase<MyCustomOrderLineRuleProviderSettings>
{
    public override async Task<DiscountRuleResult> ValidateRuleAsync(DiscountRuleContext ctx, MyCustomOrderLineRuleProviderSettings settings)
    {
        if (/* Some custom logic */)
            return Fulfilled(fulfilledOrderLines);

        return Unfulfilled();
    }
}

public class MyCustomOrderLineRuleProviderSettings
{
    [DiscountRuleProviderSetting(Key = "priceType")]
    public OrderPriceType PriceType { get; set; }

    ...
}

```

All Order Line Discount Rule Providers inherit from a base class `OrderLineDiscountRuleProviderBase<TSettings>` and follows much the same requirements as the Order Discount Rule Provider defined above. Where they differ is in the `ValidateRule` method implementation and when a fulfilled `DiscountRuleResult` is returned. In this case, an Order Line Discount Rule returns a collection of Order Lines processed by the Rule that have met the rules criteria. Whether the rules are met, is checked by calling `return Fulfilled(fulfilledOrderLines);`.

## Discount Rewards

### Example: Custom Discount Reward Provider

An example of a Discount Reward Provider would look something like this:

```csharp
[DiscountRewardProvider("myDiscountReward")]
public class MyDiscountRewardProvider : DiscountRewardProviderBase<MyDiscountRewardProviderSettings>
{
    public override async Task<DiscountRewardCalculation> CalculateRewardAsync(DiscountRewardContext ctx, MyDiscountRewardProviderSettings settings)
    {
        var result = new DiscountRewardCalculation();

        // Some custom calculation logic goes here

        return result;
    }
}

public class MyDiscountRewardProviderSettings
{
    [DiscountRewardProviderSetting(Key = "priceType")]
    public OrderPriceType PriceType { get; set; }

    ...
}

```

All Discount Reward Providers inherit from a base class `DiscountRewardProviderBase<TSettings>`. `TSettings` is the Type of a POCO model class representing the Discount Reward Providers settings.

{% hint style="info" %}
See the [Settings Objects](settings-objects.md) documentation for more information on Settings objects.
{% endhint %}

The class must be decorated with `DiscountRewardProviderAttribute` which defines the Discount Reward Providers `alias` and `name`. It can also specify a `description` or `icon` to be displayed in the Umbraco Commerce backoffice. The `DiscountRewardProviderAttribute` is responsible for defining a `labelView` for the Provider.

{% hint style="info" %}
See the [Label views](discount-rules-and-rewards.md#label-views) section below for more information on Label Views.
{% endhint %}

Reward Providers have a `CalculateReward` method that accepts a `DiscountRewardContext` as well as an instance of the Providers `TSettings` settings model. Inside this, you can perform your custom calculation logic, returning a `DiscountRewardCalculation` instance that defines any Reward values to apply to the Order.

```csharp
// Add a shipping total discount
result.ShippingTotalPriceAdjustments.Add(new DiscountAdjustment(ctx.Discount, price));

// Add a subtotal discount
result.SubtotalPriceAdjustments.Add(new DiscountAdjustment(ctx.Discount, price));
```

## Common Features

### Settings Objects

### Labels

Both the `DiscountRuleProviderAttribute` and the `DiscountRewardProviderAttribute` allow you to define a `LabelUiAlias` for the Provider. This should be the alias of a UI component registered as a Property Editor UI implementation.

A basic label component is defined as follows:

```typescript
import { customElement, html, property } from "@umbraco-cms/backoffice/external/lit";
import { UmbLitElement } from "@umbraco-cms/backoffice/lit-element";

@customElement('my-discount-rule-label')
export class MyDiscountRuleLabelElement extends UmbLitElement {

    @property()
    value?:Record<string, unknown>;

    render() {
        return html`-- CREATE YOUR LABEL HERE --`
    }
}

export default MyDiscountRuleLabelElement;

declare global {
    interface HTMLElementTagNameMap {
        'my-discount-rule-label': MyDiscountRuleLabelElement;
    }
}

```

The component will pass a `Record<string, unknown>` value representing the rule/rewards configured values. Use this value to create your label.

Once defined, your component can be registered as a Property Editor UI via a manifest entry.

```javascript
const myDiscountRuleLabelManifest = {
    type: "propertyEditorUi",
    alias: "My.PropertyEditorUi.MyDiscountRuleLabel",
    name: "My Discount Rule Label",
    element: () => import('./my-discount-rule-label.element.js')
  };

  export const manifests = [ myDiscountRuleLabelManifest ];
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Without a defined scheme, the Property Editor UI will not display in Umbraco's backoffice as a pickable property editor for use on Document Types.
{% endhint %}

The Rule/Reward Label component should provide a user-friendly summary of its settings to display in the relevant Builder UI.

## Localization

When displaying your rule/reward in the picker modal, or when displaying the configurable settings for your your rule/reward, it is neceserray to provide localizable labels. This is controlled by Umbracos [UI Localization](https://docs.umbraco.com/umbraco-cms/extending/language-files/ui-localization) feature.

Umbraco Commerce will automatically look for the following entries:

| Key |  Description |
| --- | --- | 
| `ucDiscount{type}Providers_{providerAlias}Label` | A main label for the rule/reward provider |
| `ucDiscount{type}Providers_{providerAlias}Description` | A description for the rule/reward provider |
| `ucDiscount{type}Providers_{providerAlias}Settings{settingAlias}Label` | A label for a rule/reward provider setting |
| `ucDiscount{type}Providers_{providerAlias}Settings{settingAlias}Description` | A description for a rule/reward provider setting |

Here `{type}` can be either `Rule` or `Reward`. `{providerAlias}` is the alias of the rule/reward provider, and `{settingAlias}` is the alias of a setting.
