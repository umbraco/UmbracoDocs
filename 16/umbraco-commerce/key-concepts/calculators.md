# Calculators

Calculators are small service implementations with the sole responsibility of calculating prices for a given aspect of an Order. There are five main Calculator service interfaces in Umbraco Commerce:

* **IShippingCalculator** - Responsible for calculating the Shipping Method price/tax rate of a given Shipping Method.
* **IPaymentCalculator** - Responsible for calculating the Payment Method price/tax rate of a given Payment Method.
* **IProductCalculator** - Responsible for calculating the Product unit price/tax rate of a given Product.
* **IOrderLineCalculator** - Responsible for calculating the price/tax rate of a given OrderLine.
* **IOrderCalculator** - Responsible for calculating the entire Order.

All Calculator services can be replaced with alternative implementations should you wish to change how Umbraco Commerce performs its calculations.

## Defining a Custom Calculator Implementation

The individual Calculator interfaces may differ but the process for defining a custom Calculator implementation is the same for all of them. It is possible to create a new class that implements the default system Calculator that you wish to replace. You can then override the relevant calculation methods.

```csharp
public class MyProductCalculator : ProductCalculator
{
    public MyProductCalculator(ITaxService taxService, IStoreService storeService)
        : base(taxService, storeService)
    { }

    public override async Task<TaxRate> CalculateProductTaxRateAsync(IProductSnapshot productSnapshot, TaxSource taxSource, TaxRate fallbackTaxRate)
    {
        // Do custom tax rate calculation here
    }

    public override async Task<Price> CalculateProductPriceAsync(IProductSnapshot productSnapshot, Guid currencyId, TaxRate taxRate)
    {
        // Do custom price calculation here
    }
}

```

## Registering a custom Calculator implementation

Calculators are [registered via the IUmbracoCommerceBuilder](umbraco-commerce-builder.md) interface using the `AddUnique<TServiceInterface, TReplacementService>()` method on the `Services` property. The `TServiceInterface` parameter in this case is the Calculator interface Type you wish to replace and `TReplacementService` is the Type of your custom Calculator implementation.

```csharp
public static class UmbracoCommerceUmbracoBuilderExtensions
{
    public static IUmbracoCommerceBuilder AddMyServices(IUmbracoCommerceBuilder builder)
    {
        // Replacing the product calculator implementation
        builder.Services.AddUnique<IProductCalculator, MyProductCalculator>();

        // Return the builder to continue the chain
        return builder;
    }
}
```
