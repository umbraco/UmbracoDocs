# Discount Rewards

Discount rewards define what discount should be applied when discount rules are satisfied. The reward system supports discounts such as percentage reductions, product-specific offers, and free shipping promotions.

## How Rewards Work

When discount rules are satisfied, the associated rewards are applied to the order. Rewards can target different aspects of an order, including the overall order value, specific order lines, shipping costs, or payment fees.

The rules system determines when a discount should be applied. Rules can be single conditions or complex multi-layered logic structures.

### Logical Operators
Rules can be grouped using three types of logic:
- **`ALL`** - Every rule in the group must be satisfied
- **`ANY`** - At least one rule in the group must be satisfied
- **`FUNNEL`** - Rules are applied sequentially, with matching items passed to the next rule

### Funnel Logic
Funnel logic is particularly powerful for product-specific discounts. Order lines that match the first rule are passed to subsequent rules for additional filtering. This enables scenarios like "Buy 2 shirts and get 20% off pants" where the system first identifies shirt purchases, then applies discounts to pants.

### Blocking Options
Rules can include blocking conditions to prevent discount stacking:
- **Block Further Discounts** - Prevent other discounts from applying if this one is used
- **Block if Other Discounts Apply** - Don't apply this discount if others are already active

For detailed information about available rules and their configuration, see the [Rules Reference](../rules/).
