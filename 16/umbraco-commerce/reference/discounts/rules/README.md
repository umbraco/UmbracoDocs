# Discount Rules

Discount rules define the conditions that must be met for a discount to be applied to an order. The rule system in Umbraco Commerce is highly flexible, allowing you to create single-condition rules or complex multi-layered logic structures.

![Discount Rules Overview](../../../media/discounts/discount-rules-config.png)

## How Rules Work

Rules are evaluated against orders during the checkout process. When all conditions within a rule (or rule group) are satisfied, the associated discount rewards are applied. Rules can be combined using logical operators to create sophisticated discount scenarios.

## Rule Types

### Group Rule
The Group rule acts as a container for other rules, allowing you to combine multiple conditions using logical operators.

**Configuration:**
- **Match Type** - Choose between `ALL`, `ANY`, or `FUNNEL` logic
- **Child Rules** - Add one or more rules to the group

![Group Rule Configuration](../../../media/discounts/group-discount-type.png)

**Match Types:**
- **`ALL`** - Every child rule must be satisfied
- **`ANY`** - At least one child rule must be satisfied
- **`FUNNEL`** - Rules are applied sequentially, with matching line items passed to the next rule

For detailed examples and explanations of how each match type works, see [Rule Logic and Grouping](#rule-logic-and-grouping).

**Use Cases:**
- Complex multi-condition discounts
- Hierarchical rule structures
- Sequential filtering scenarios

### Country Rule
Checks if the order's billing or shipping country matches specific countries.

**Configuration:**

## Rule Logic and Grouping

### `ALL` Logic
All child rules within the group must be satisfied for the group to pass. This creates an "`AND`" relationship between rules.

**Example:** Free shipping for VIP members with orders over $100
- Rule Group (`ALL` Logic)
  - Member Group Rule: "VIP Members"
  - Order Amount Rule: Greater than Â£100

![All Logic Example](../../../media/discounts/group-discount-type-all-config.png)

### `ANY` Logic
At least one child rule within the group must be satisfied for the group to pass. This creates an "OR" relationship between rules.

**Example:** Student or senior citizen discount
- Rule Group (`ANY` Logic)
  - Member Group Rule: "Students"
  - Member Group Rule: "Senior Citizens"

![Any Logic Example](../../../media/discounts/group-discount-type-any-config.png)

### `FUNNEL` Logic
Rules are applied sequentially, with order lines that match the first rule being passed to subsequent rules for additional filtering. This is particularly powerful for product-specific discounts.

**Example:** Buy more than 2 accessories to get a discount
- Rule Group (`FUNNEL` Logic)
  - Order Line Product Category Rule: "Accessories"
  - Order Line Quantity: Greater than 2

The funnel logic first identifies orders with accessories, then checks if the quantity of those accessories exceeds 2 to apply the discount.

![Funnel Logic Example](../../../media/discounts/group-discount-type-funnel-config.png)

## Rule Blocking Options

Rules can include blocking conditions to prevent discount stacking and ensure certain discounts are prioritized.

**Options:**
- **Block further discounts from being applied** - Prevent other discounts from applying if this one is used
- **Block discount if discounts already apply** - Don't apply this discount if others are already active

![Rule Blocking Options](../../../media/discounts/discount-rule-blocking-options.png)

**Use Cases:**
- Exclusive promotions
- Preventing over-discounting
- Prioritizing high-value discounts

## Rule Performance Considerations

### Optimization Tips
- **Order Rules by Complexity** - Place simpler rules first to fail fast
- **Use Specific Product Rules Sparingly** - They can be more resource-intensive
- **Limit Deep Nesting** - Avoid overly complex rule hierarchies
- **Cache Expensive Calculations** - For custom property rules with complex logic

## Custom Rule Provider Development

The rule system is extensible, allowing developers to create custom rules for specific business requirements.

See the [Discount Rules & Rewards Key Concepts](../../../key-concepts/discount-rules-and-rewards.md) for guidance on creating custom rules.
