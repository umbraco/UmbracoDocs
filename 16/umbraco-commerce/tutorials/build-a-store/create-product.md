# Creating your first Product

By default, products in Umbraco Commerce are regular content nodes. These can consist of any number of properties depending on the site design. To be considered a product, however, a Document Type must contain the fields `Sku` and `Price`, with their corresponding aliases `sku` and `price`.

## Create a Product Composition

Because any node in Umbraco can be a product, the first step is to create a **Product** Composition. This composition can be applied to any Document Type to make it a product.

1. Navigate to the **Settings** section of the backoffice.
2. Create a new Element Type called **Product**.
3. Add an SKU property with the alias `sku` and select the `Text Box Editor`.
4. Add a Price property with the alias `price` and select the `Price Property Editor` that comes with Umbraco Commerce.

6. Click **Save** to create the Element Type.

## Create a Product Document Type

With the product composition created, you can now create a Document Tyoe for a product.

1. Navigate to the **Settings** section of the backoffice.
2. Create or open a Document Type that you want to use as a product.
3. Click the **Compositions** button.
4. Select the `Product` composition you created earlier and **Submit**.

6. Click **Save** to save the changes.

## Allow Creating Product Pages

If you haven't already, you'll need to allow the product Document Type to be a child node of the store root or product container Document Type.

1. Open your store root or product container Document Type to edit.
2. Navigate to the **Structure** tab.
3. Add our new Document Type to the **Allowed child node types** property.

## Create a Product

1. Navigate to the **Content** section of the backoffice.
2. Create a new content node somewhere beneath the store root using the Document Type you created earlier.
