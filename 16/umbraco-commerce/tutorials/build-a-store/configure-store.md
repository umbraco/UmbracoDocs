# Configuring your Store

Each store comes with a set of predefined configurations that you can extend, covering:

* [Locations](#setting-up-a-location)
* [Order Statuses](#setting-up-order-statuses)
* [Payment Methods](#setting-up-payment-methods)
* [Shipping Methods](#setting-up-shipping-methods)
* [Countries](#setting-up-a-country)
* [Currencies](#setting-up-a-currency)
* [Taxes](#setting-up-taxes)
* [Templates](#setting-up-templates)

## Setting up a Location

If your business operates in multiple regions, setting up locations helps:

* Configure stores for different locations with separate languages, shipping addresses, regional offers, local regulations, and payment gateways.
* Ship products from different locations. The system can be set up to route orders to the nearest warehouse based on the customerâ€™s location.

### Steps to set up a location

1. Select your store from the **Stores** menu in the **Settings** section. In this case, *Umbraco Swag Store*.
2. Go to **Locations** under the Store.
3. Click **Create Location**.
4. Enter the **Name** for the Location. For example: *Denmark*
5. Provide the necessary address details.

6. **Save** the changes.

## Setting up Order Statuses

Order Status tracks the progression of an order. It helps both the store owner and customers track the order's progress from the moment it is placed until it is delivered (or returned).

When you first set up Umbraco Commerce, it comes with predefined order statuses to help manage the order lifecycle. These statuses include *New*, *Completed*, *Cancelled*, and *Error*. The statuses can be customized based on your specific business requirements.

### Steps to create an order status

1. Go to **Order Statuses** under the Store.
2. Click **Create Order Status**.
3. Enter a **Name** for the order status. For Example: *Processing*
4. Select a **Color** for the order status.
