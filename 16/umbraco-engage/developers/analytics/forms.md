# Extending forms

To track Umbraco Forms submissions, you need to install [Umbraco Forms](https://umbraco.com/products/add-ons/forms/) with a valid license from Umbraco HQ. You also need to install the Umbraco Engage [Forms Addon package from Nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Umbraco.Engage.Forms).

## Summary

Umbraco Engage measures interactions with Umbraco Forms on your website automatically if you include the Umbraco Engage [analytics JavaScript file](client-side-events-and-additional-javascript-files/additional-measurements-with-the-analytics-scripts.md). No additional configuration is needed. The data is visualized in the backoffice in Engage > Analytics > Forms.

{% hint style="info" %}
The following Umbraco Forms script loading types are currently not supported: "async" or "defer".
{% endhint %}

The following is measured:

* The time a visitor started filling in the form.
* The time a visitor finished filling in the form (like when it was submitted).
* If the visitor has seen the form, and whether it was in their viewport.
* If the form was submitted successfully.
  * This is based on client-side validation only. If client-side validation passes it is seen as a successful submit.
* If the form raised any client-side errors, and how many was raised.
* Focus/unfocus events of each field and whether the field was empty or contained data at that time.

### Tracking a visitor Form submissions

It is possible to track a specific visitor to your website and see if they have made any form submissions. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Edit the Umbraco Form you wish to track visitors for and go to the **Design** view.
2. Add a new field to your form called '`Analytics - VisitorId`\`.
3. Give the new form field a name such as **Visitor ID**.
4. Specify a URL in the settings of the field type called **Template**:

```console
https://**yoursite.com**/umbraco/#Engage/profiles/profiles/insights?id=**[[visitor.id]]**`
```

The URL above is a link to your website, including a visitor ID. By using a URL like this you can click directly through to view the visitor profile from Forms workflows. This includes emails, Slack messages as well as exported Excel data.

## Disable Umbraco Forms tracking

By adding the `engage-no-tracking` attribute you can disable Umbraco Forms tracking on the form or field level. The attribute needs to be added to either the form tag or to a field tag (like input, select, or textarea).
