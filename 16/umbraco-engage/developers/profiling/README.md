# Profiling

Profiling is tracking and analyzing visitor behavior to build detailed visitor profiles.

This involves collecting data from website interactions to understand user preferences and customize content and marketing strategies accordingly. Profiles are dynamically updated as users interact with the site, allowing for more personalized and targeted marketing efforts over time.

## [External Profile Data](external-profile-data.md)

In Umbraco Engage, you can integrate data from external systems with visitor profiles. Although Umbraco Engage does not provide built-in methods for adding this data, you can store it in any format.
