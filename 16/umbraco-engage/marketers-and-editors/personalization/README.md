  Personalization is one of the key features within Umbraco Engage. In a fully
  integrated way you can personalize the experience of each of your visitors
  within Umbraco.

# Personalization

## Creating a segment

The first thing you need to do is [create a segment](creating-a-segment.md). A segment is a group of visitors within your website. When setting up a segment you can define which visitors are in a segment.

## Personalizing the website for this segment

Once you've created a segment you can [personalize the experience of your visitor](setting-up-personalization.md). This can be done on a specific page, on multiple pages, or per Document Type.

## Explicit and implicit personalization

Umbraco Engage allows you to personalize your Umbraco website via [implicit or explicit personalization](implicit-and-explicit-personalization/). To grasp the way Umbraco Engage handles implicit personalization read the[ implicit personalization scoring](implicit-and-explicit-personalization/implicit-personalization-scoring-explained.md) article. Another option is to see it in action in [the cockpit view](cockpit-insights.md) at the front end of your Umbraco website.

## Extending personalization

If you want to take your personalization to the next level you can always extend the way the personalization in Umbraco Engage works by default. Contact the technical team and refer to the [Personalization section for Developers](../../developers/personalization/).
