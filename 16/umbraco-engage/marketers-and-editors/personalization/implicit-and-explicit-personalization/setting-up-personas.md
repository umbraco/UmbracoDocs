# Personas

This can be done by going to the Engage section in your Umbraco installation and the sub-section "**Personalization**". There you can navigate to the tab "**Personas**".

Here you can create one or more persona groups, and within each group, you can create one or more personas.

## Personas

Personas are an important concept for implicit personalization in Umbraco Engage. A persona is an archetypal user whose goals, needs, and characteristics represent a group of visitors to your website. By creating personas you can define behavior on your website and personalize the website experience depending on the persona's needs.

Creating personas is something that you should do for your website. If it's your first time coming up with personas we always advise creating a maximum of 3 personas.

If you want to add many more personas, be aware that each added persona will increase the complexity of finding good personalization strategies. And every extra persona requires extra content.

As an example we have three different personas:

* **The data & privacy officer**. This type of visitor is mainly interested in how Umbraco Engage is safeguarding data storage and GDPR ruling.
* **The developer**. This persona is interested in how to set up Umbraco Engage.
* **The marketer**. This persona is looking for inspiration and functionalities; what has Umbraco Engage to offer.

To learn how you can set up Personas in Umbraco Engage read the [How to create a Persona](../../../tutorials/how-to-create-a-persona.md) guide.
