# Client-side Events

Umbraco Engage helps you with some additional scripts and views.\
Find more information about the scripts in the [Analytics section for Developers](../../developers/analytics/client-side-events-and-additional-javascript-files/).

### GA4 events

If you are using the [GA4 bridging script](../../developers/analytics/client-side-events-and-additional-javascript-files/bridging-library-for-google-analytics.md) the captured GA4 events will appear in Analytics -> Events in the **GA 4 - Bridging** category.
