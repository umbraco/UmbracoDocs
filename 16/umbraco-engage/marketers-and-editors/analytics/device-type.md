# Device Type

In the **Devices** report within **Analytics**, you can view the ratio of visitors using different devices. It shows how many visitors access your website via desktop, tablet, and mobile.

Umbraco Engage determines the visitor’s device type using [DeviceDetector.NET](https://github.com/totpero/DeviceDetector.NET), an open-source library that analyzes the browser’s User Agent.
