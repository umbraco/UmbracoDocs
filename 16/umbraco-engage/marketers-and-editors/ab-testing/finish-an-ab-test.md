# Finish an A/B Test

You can decide to finish an A/B test at any time. Normally, you would end a test if it has been running long enough and enough data to gain enough confidence is collected.

Umbraco Engage lets you know when the collected data is statistically significant. The same applies to when not enough data is collected.

Even if not enough data is collected you can always decide whether a running A/B Test is complete. In the overview you can see all tests and their performance:

</div>

To end a test, click **End test**. This will open a confirmation dialog asking if you want to pick a winner directly.

You might want to discuss the results with a colleague or client. In that case, it makes sense to stop the A/B test, but complete it by picking a winner at a later point.

If you select **Stop and complete now** the A/B Test is stopped and you can select which variant was the winner:

</div>

You can always pick one of the variants or **My test did not result in a winner**. After you confirm your selected winner the overview will show the picked winner:

</div>

The overview of the A/B tests will also not show that the A/B Test is stopped and a winner was selected:
