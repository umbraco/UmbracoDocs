# Types of A/B Tests

Three different types of A/B tests are available:

* [Single-page tests](single-page-ab-test.md) to test a specific page within Umbraco.
* A way to test [multiple pages](multiple-pages-test.md) at the same time.
* Test an entire [Document Type](document-type-test.md) and all of the pages using this type.
* [Split URL testing](split-url-test.md). This enables you to select two or multiple pages and serve one of these URLs per visitor.

The A/B tests are set up within an Umbraco context. You can reuse properties that are already created. Umbraco Engage is also aware of the structure of your website and concepts like Document Types.

When setting up the A/B test, you can select the type of test you want to set up.

A Single-Page test can only be started in the A/B test [Content App](../../introduction/content-apps.md) and not from the Engage [section](../../introduction/the-umbraco-engage-section.md).
