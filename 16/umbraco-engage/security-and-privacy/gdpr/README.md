# GDPR & EU regulation

**Disclaimer**: Always check you are GDPR compliant with your own privacy office or legal department

Umbraco Engage cares about privacy and values insights. We have turned this into a standard for you and your customers. Server-side analytics in combination with a first-party cookie is quick to set up. And even better, you own your data.

You can be GDPR compliant out of the box.

## Privacy is our concern

Umbraco Engage principles:

* Umbraco Engage uses specific retention periods and personal data is not kept longer than necessary.
* Umbraco Engage has set up its software according to the principles of privacy by design and by default.

## GDPR Compliance

Umbraco Engage has been designed with the principles of privacy by design and privacy by default in mind. For example, the following measures have been taken:

* The retention period for **the Umbraco Engage cookie is 365 days by default**.
* The data is **anonymized after two years**, and **fully deleted after three years**.
* The IP address is pseudonymized by default.
* The use of view and click behavior is optional.
* Neither Umbraco Engage nor any other third party has access to the data\
  (except for, for example, custom hosting provider), as the cookie is first\
  party.

You can change the default settings. However, we do not recommend doing so, as they are set in line with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
