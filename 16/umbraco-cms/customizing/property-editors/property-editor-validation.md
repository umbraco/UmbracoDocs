# Property Editor Validation

Adding Validation rules to a Property Editor is the same as adding Validation Rules to any Web Component. But it does require that your Web Component be a Form Control.

To achieve this, you can use a Mixin called `UmbFormControlMixin` . The following example shows how this could look:

```typescript
import { customElement } from '@umbraco-cms/backoffice/external/lit';
import { UmbLitElement } from '@umbraco-cms/backoffice/lit-element';
import { UmbFormControlMixin } from '@umbraco-cms/backoffice/validation';

@customElement('my-property-editor')
export class MyPropertyEditorElement
	extends UmbFormControlMixin<string | undefined, typeof UmbLitElement, undefined>(UmbLitElement)
	implements UmbPropertyEditorUiElement {
	
	/**
	Notice 'value'-property is already defined via the FormControlMixin, based on the first generic type given to it
	*/
	
	...

}

export default MyPropertyEditorElement;

declare global {
	interface HTMLElementTagNameMap {
		'my-property-editor': MyPropertyEditorElement;
	}
}

```

### Add Validation rules

Once your Property Editor is a Form Control, you can append validation rules to it.

```typescript
...
	
	constructor() {
		super();

		this.addValidator(
			'customError',
			() => 'This field must contain a "Unicorn"',
			() => !this.value.includes("unicorn"),
		);
	}

...
```

The first argument declares what type of validation error you are evaluating. You can see the various types that browsers support on the [Mozilla Development Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ValidityState#instance_properties).

The second argument is a method that returns the message; this message will be displayed if the Validator Check returns `true`.

The third argument is the Validator check, which is executed every time there is a change in the properties of this Web Component. If it returns `true` , the component will turn invalid, and the messages of argument two will be used as feedback to the user.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you're looking to make server requests as part of your check, then it is recommended to avoid calling the server more often than needed. Do only ask the server if there is a value, and only ask the server again if the value is different from last time.
{% endhint %}

Notice that `value` is already defined in the FormControlMixin, and ideally, you do not overwrite it. If so, then please make sure to still set the value property of the Mixin. As that will trigger a validation update.

```typescript
	@property({ type: String })
	public override set value(value: string) {
		// [ What you needed to do... ]
		super.value = value;
	}
	public override get value() {
		return super.value;
	}
```

### Integrate the validation of an inner element

You may have inner elements that are `FormControls`  and should affect the validity of your property editor.\
In this case, bind the inner element to the property editor.

The following example shows how to make a local `uui-input` part of the property editorâ€™s validation.

```typescript
...
	
	protected override firstUpdated() {
		this.addFormControlElement(this.shadowRoot!.querySelector('uui-input')!);
	}

...
```

{% hint style="info" %}
This example requires your property editor to be built with Lit. If you are not using Lit, you need another way to detect when the element is in the DOM or to create it virtually.
{% endhint %}
