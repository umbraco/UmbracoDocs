# Extension Registry

The Extensions Registry is your entry to extend or customize the Backoffice. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the abilities of the Extension Registry.

## [Extension Registration](extension-registry.md) <a href="#registration" id="registration"></a>

The extension registry is a global registry that can be accessed and changed at any time while Backoffice is running.

## [Extension Manifest](extension-manifest.md)

Each Extension Manifest has to declare its type. This is used to determine where it hooks into the system. It also looks at what data is required to declare within it.

## [Replace, Exclude, or Unregister](replace-exclude-or-unregister.md)

Once you understand how to declare your own, you may want to replace or remove existing ones.
