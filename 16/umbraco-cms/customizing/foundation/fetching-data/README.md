# Fetching Data

## Fetch Data Through HTTP

There are two main ways to fetch data through HTTP in the Umbraco Backoffice:

* [Fetch API](./#fetch-api)
* [Umbraco HTTP Client](./#umbraco-http-client).

The Fetch API is a modern way to make network requests in JavaScript, while the Umbraco HTTP client is a wrapper around it, providing a more convenient interface.

For most scenarios, the Umbraco HTTP Client is recommended because it:

* Automatically handles authentication and error handling.
* Provides type safety for requests and responses.
* Simplifies request and response parsing.
* Integrates seamlessly with the Backoffice.

The Fetch API is an alternative for simpler use cases.

The following table provides a comparison of the two options:

| Feature              | [Fetch API](fetch-api.md) | [Umbraco HTTP Client](http-client.md) |
| -------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Authentication       | Manual                    | Automatic                             |
| Error Handling       | Manual                    | Built-in                              |
| Type Safety          | No                        | Yes                                   |
| Request Cancellation | Yes (via AbortController) | Yes (via AbortController)             |
| Recommended Use Case | Common requests           | Complex or frequent requests          |

After selecting a method, refer to the sections below for implementation details and guidance on handling the received data.

### [Fetch API](fetch-api.md)

The Fetch API is a modern way to make network requests in JavaScript. It provides a more powerful and flexible feature set than the older XMLHttpRequest.

### [Umbraco HTTP Client](http-client.md)

The Umbraco HTTP Client is a wrapper around the Fetch API that provides a more convenient way to make network requests. It handles request and response parsing, error handling, and retries.

## Handle Requests

Once you have chosen a method to fetch data, the next step is to handle the execution of requests. This includes managing errors, refreshing tokens, and ensuring proper authentication.

## [Executing Requests](try-execute.md)

After fetching data, the next step is to execute the request. You can use the `tryExecute` function to handle errors and refresh the token if it is expired.

### [Custom Generated Client](custom-generated-client.md)

For advanced scenarios, you can generate a custom client for your API using tools like [@hey-api/openapi-ts](https://github.com/hey-api/openapi-ts). This approach is ideal when working with custom API controllers or when you need type-safe, reusable client code.
