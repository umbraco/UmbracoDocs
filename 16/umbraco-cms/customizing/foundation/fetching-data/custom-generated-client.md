# Custom Generated Client

Umbraco uses [@hey-api/openapi-ts](https://heyapi.dev/openapi-ts/get-started) to generate its HTTP client for the OpenAPI specification of the Management API. It is available through the `@umbraco-cms/backoffice/http-client` package.

{% content-ref url="http-client.md" %}
[http-client.md](http-client.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

The following examples show how to generate a client from an OpenAPI specification and how to use it in the project. Below, the `@hey-api/openapi-ts` library is used, but the same principles apply to any other library that generates a TypeScript client.

## Generate your own client

The generated client provides a convenient way to make requests to the specified API with type-safety without having to manually write the requests yourself. Consider generating a client to save time and reduce effort when working with custom API controllers.

To get started, install the generator using the following command:

```bash
npm install @hey-api/openapi-ts
```

Then, use the `openapi-ts` command to generate a client from your OpenAPI specification:

```bash
npx openapi-ts --input https://example.com/openapi.json --output ./my-client
```

This will generate a TypeScript client in the `./my-client` folder. Import the generated client into your project to make requests to the Management API.

To learn more about OpenAPI and how to define your API specification, visit the [OpenAPI Documentation](https://swagger.io/specification/).

## Connecting to the Management API

You will need to set up a few configuration options in order to connect to the Management API. The following options are required:

- `auth`: The authentication method to use. This is typically `Bearer` for the Management API.
- `baseUrl`: The base URL of the Management API. This is typically `https://example.com/umbraco/api/management/v1`.
- `credentials`: The credentials to use for the request. This is typically `same-origin` for the Management API.

You can set these options either directly with the `openapi-ts` command or in a central place in your code. For example, you can create a [BackofficeEntryPoint](../../extending-overview/extension-types/backoffice-entry-point.md) that sets up the configuration options for the HTTP client:

```javascript
import { UMB_AUTH_CONTEXT } from '@umbraco-cms/backoffice/auth';
import { client } from './my-client/client.gen';

export const onInit = (host) => {
    host.consumeContext(UMB_AUTH_CONTEXT, (authContext) => {
        // Get the token info from Umbraco
        const config = authContext?.getOpenApiConfiguration();

        client.setConfig({
          auth: config?.token ?? undefined,
          baseUrl: config?.base ?? "",
          credentials: config?.credentials ?? "same-origin",
        });
    });
};
```

This sets up the HTTP client with the Management APIâ€™s base URL and authentication method.. You can then use the client to make requests to the Management API.

See the example in action in the [Umbraco Extension Template](../../development-flow/umbraco-extension-template.md).
{% endhint %}

### Fetch API

A Backoffice Entry Point is recommended when working with multiple requests. However, if you only have a few requests to make, you can use the `fetch` function directly. Read more about that here:

{% content-ref url="fetch-api.md" %}
[fetch-api.md](fetch-api.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

**Setting the client directly**
You can also set the client directly in your code. This is useful if you only have a few requests to make and don't want to set up a Backoffice Entry Point.

```javascript
import { getMyControllerAction } from './my-client';
import { tryExecute } from '@umbraco-cms/backoffice/resources';
import { umbHttpClient } from '@umbraco-cms/backoffice/http-client';

const { data } = await tryExecute(this, getMyControllerAction({
    client: umbHttpClient, // Use Umbraco's HTTP client
}));

if (data) {
    console.log('Server status:', data);
}
```

The above example shows how to use the `getMyControllerAction` function, which is generated through `openapi-ts`. The `client` parameter is the HTTP client that you want to use. You can use any HTTP client that implements the underlying interface from `@hey-api/openapi-ts`, which the Umbraco HTTP Client does. The `getMyControllerAction` function will then use the Umbraco HTTP client over its own to make the request to the Management API.
