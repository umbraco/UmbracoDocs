# Icons

The icons from the Umbraco backoffice are based on [Lucide Icons](https://lucide.dev/). The syntax for getting the icons starts with`icon-`. You can find the list of all icons in the [Icon registry list on GitHub](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.CMS.Backoffice/tree/762e43b2f49ca483df9cfe28de20f31ca07bb22b/src/packages/core/icon-registry/icons).
