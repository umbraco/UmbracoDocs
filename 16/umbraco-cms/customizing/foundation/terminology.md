# Terminology

Understanding certain key concepts is essential when customizing the backoffice. These terminologies can help you decode the purpose of code effectively:

* **Repository:** An API enables communication with a server.
* **Store:** An API representing data, generally coming from the server. Most stores would talk with one or more resources. You can read more about this in the [Store](../../customizing/foundation/working-with-data/store.md) article.
* **State:** A reactive container holding data, when data is changed all its Observables will be notified. You can read more about state and observables in the [States](../../customizing/foundation/working-with-data/states.md) article.
  * **Observable:** An observable is the hook for others to subscribe to the data of a State.
  * **Observe:** Observe describes what we do when subscribing to an Observable.
* **Context-API:** The name used to serve APIs (instances/classes) for a certain context in the DOM. An API that is served via the Context-API is called a Context. You can read more about this in the [Context API](../../customizing/foundation/working-with-data/context-api.md) article.
  * **Context Provider:** One that provides a class instance as a Context API.
  * **Context Consumer:** One that consumer subscribes to a class instance as a Context API.
* **Controller:** An abstract term for a thing that hooks into the lifecycle of an element. Many things in our system are Controllers.
* **Umbraco Controller:** Enables hosting controllers. Additionally, it provides a few shortcut methods for initializing core Umbraco Controllers. You can read more about this in the [Controllers](../../customizing/foundation/umbraco-element/controllers/) article.
  * **Controller Host:** A class that can host controllers.
  * **Controller Host Element:** The element that can host controllers.
* **Umbraco Element:** The `UmbLitElement` or `UmbElemenMixin` enables hosting controllers. Additionally, it provides a few shortcut methods for initializing core Umbraco Controllers. You can read more about this in the [Umbraco Element](../../customizing/foundation/umbraco-element/) article.
