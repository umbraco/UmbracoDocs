# Release Candidate Guide

## How to test the Release Candidate

{% hint style="warning" %}
To install the Umbraco 15 Release Candidate you need the latest [.NET SDK 9.0.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/9.0).
{% endhint %}

The[ release candidate is available on NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Umbraco.Cms/15.0.0-rc2).

1. Install the Umbraco dotnet template for the Release Candidate.

```
dotnet new install Umbraco.Templates::15.0.0-rc*
```

2. Create a new Umbraco project.

```
dotnet new umbraco -n MyCustomUmbracoProject
```

3. Navigate to the newly created folder.

```
cd MyCustomUmbracoProject
```

4. Build the project.

```
dotnet build
```

5. Run the project.

```
dotnet run
```

This will boot the project, and write the log to the console. The website is now running on your local machine and will be available on the ports written in the console.

{% hint style="info" %}
Alternatively, you can install and run the Umbraco project using your favorite IDE (Integrated Development Environment).
{% endhint %}
