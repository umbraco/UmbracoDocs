# FileSystemProviders Configuration

Filesystem providers are configured via code, you can either configure it in a composer, or in the `Program.cs` file.

```csharp
using Umbraco.Cms.Core.Composing;
using Umbraco.Cms.Core.IO;
using Umbraco.Cms.Infrastructure.DependencyInjection;
using IHostingEnvironment = Umbraco.Cms.Core.Hosting.IHostingEnvironment;

namespace FilesystemProviders;

public class FilesystemComposer : IComposer
{
 public void Compose(IUmbracoBuilder builder) =>
  builder.SetMediaFileSystem(factory =>
  {
   IHostingEnvironment hostingEnvironment = factory.GetRequiredService<IHostingEnvironment>();
   IWebHostEnvironment webHostEnvironment = factory.GetRequiredService<IWebHostEnvironment>();
   var folderLocation = "~/CustomMediaFolder";
   var rootPath = webHostEnvironment.MapPathWebRoot(folderLocation);
   var rootUrl = hostingEnvironment.ToAbsolute(folderLocation);

   return new PhysicalFileSystem(
    factory.GetRequiredService<IIOHelper>(),
    hostingEnvironment,
    factory.GetRequiredService<ILogger<PhysicalFileSystem>>(),
    rootPath,
    rootUrl);
  });
}
```

By default Umbraco will save Media in a folder called `/media` within the webroot on the Physical file system. The code snippet above will change the location to instead save the media in a folder called `/CustomMediaFolder` within the webroot.

The media provider can be of many types, for example in case you want to store media on Azure, Amazon or even DB. But the provider that comes by default with the installation of Umbraco is the `PhysicalFileSystem` provider.

## PhysicalFileSystem Configuration

The physical file system provider manages the interaction of Umbraco with the local file system. It can be configured for two different scenarios:

* Media files stored inside a virtual folder of the site
* Media files stored somewhere else outside of the site and accessed via a custom URL

### Virtual Folder

To configure the PhysicalFileSystem for a virtual folder, create a new filesystem with a root path and URL within the wwwroot folder. Refer to the example above and [Extending FileSystemProviders](../../extending/filesystemproviders/) for more information.

### Physical path

There are a few more steps involved if you want to store the media files in a separate folder outside the webroot.

First you must register the folder as a static file provider in your `Program.cs` file like so:

```csharp
...
WebApplication app = builder.Build();
app.UseStaticFiles(new StaticFileOptions
    {
        FileProvider = new PhysicalFileProvider(Path.Combine("C:", "storage", "umbracoMedia")),
        RequestPath = "/CustomPath"
    });
```

Now you can register the folder as the media filesystem

```csharp
using Umbraco.Cms.Core.Composing;
using Umbraco.Cms.Core.IO;
using Umbraco.Cms.Infrastructure.DependencyInjection;
using IHostingEnvironment = Umbraco.Cms.Core.Hosting.IHostingEnvironment;

namespace FilesystemProviders;

public class FilesystemComposer : IComposer
{
 public void Compose(IUmbracoBuilder builder)
 {
  builder.SetMediaFileSystem((factory) =>
  {
   IHostingEnvironment hostingEnvironment = factory.GetRequiredService<IHostingEnvironment>();
   var rootPath = Path.Combine("C:", "storage", "umbracoMedia");
   var rootUrl = hostingEnvironment.ToAbsolute("/CustomPath");

   return new PhysicalFileSystem(
    factory.GetRequiredService<IIOHelper>(),
    hostingEnvironment,
    factory.GetRequiredService<ILogger<PhysicalFileSystem>>(),
    rootPath,
    rootUrl);
  });
 }
}
```

This is much the same as when you register it within the wwwroot with a virutal folder. The only differnce is that now you provide an absolute root path and root URL to the physical filesystem.

* `rootPath` is the full filesystem path where you want media files to be stored. It has to be rooted, must use directory separators (`\`) and must not end with a separator. For example, `Z:` or `C:\path\to\folder` or `\\servername\path`.
* `rootUrl` is the URL where the files will be accessible from. It must use URL separators (`/`) and must not end with a separator. It can either be a folder, like `/UmbracoMedia`, in which case it will considered as subfolder of the main domain (`example.com/UmbracoMedia`) or can be a fully qualified URL, with also domain name and protocol (for ex `http://media.example.com/media`).

For more information see [Extending FileSystemProviders](../../extending/filesystemproviders/).

## Custom providers

To store media files in different systems, the type of provider must be changed. You can learn [how to build a custom filesystem provider](../../extending/filesystemproviders/#custom-file-systems-ifilesystem) in the Extending Umbraco section.

{% hint style="info" %}
At the moment when a file is saved, its full URL is stored as node property. This means that a configuration change will not apply to pre-existing media files but only to the ones saved after that.

If you want all your media files in the same location, you have to copy all pre-existing files to the new path. Additionally, you need to update the path property of the media item to the new URL. This can be either directly inside the database or by using the `MediaService`.
{% endhint %}

## Get the contents of a file as a stream

The recommended approach to obtain a file's content as a stream is to utilize the `MediaFileManager`. It is advised to avoid reading the file directly from the server using methods like `Server.MapPath`. This will ensure that, regardless of the file system provider, the stream will be returned correctly. This example demonstrates using MediaFileManager to validate file existence and stream it back from a controller.

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.StaticFiles;
using Umbraco.Cms.Core.Cache;
using Umbraco.Cms.Core.IO;
using Umbraco.Cms.Core.Logging;
using Umbraco.Cms.Core.Routing;
using Umbraco.Cms.Core.Services;
using Umbraco.Cms.Core.Web;
using Umbraco.Cms.Infrastructure.Persistence;
using Umbraco.Cms.Web.Website.Controllers;

namespace FilesystemProviders;

public class MediaController : SurfaceController
{
 private readonly MediaFileManager _mediaFileManager;
 private readonly IWebHostEnvironment _webHostEnvironment;

 public MediaController(
  IUmbracoContextAccessor umbracoContextAccessor,
  IUmbracoDatabaseFactory databaseFactory,
  ServiceContext services,
  AppCaches appCaches,
  IProfilingLogger profilingLogger,
  IPublishedUrlProvider publishedUrlProvider,
  MediaFileManager mediaFileManager,
  IWebHostEnvironment webHostEnvironment)
  : base(umbracoContextAccessor, databaseFactory, services, appCaches, profilingLogger, publishedUrlProvider)
 {
  _mediaFileManager = mediaFileManager;
  _webHostEnvironment = webHostEnvironment;
 }

 public IActionResult Index(string id, string file)
 {
  var path = _webHostEnvironment.MapPathWebRoot($"/media/{id}/{file}");
  if (_mediaFileManager.FileSystem.FileExists(path) == false)
  {
   return new NotFoundResult();
  }

  var stream = _mediaFileManager.FileSystem.OpenFile(path);
  stream.Seek(0, SeekOrigin.Begin);

  var provider = new FileExtensionContentTypeProvider();
  if (!provider.TryGetContentType(file, out var contentType))
  {
   contentType = "application/octet-stream";
  }

  return new FileStreamResult(stream, contentType);

 }
}
```
