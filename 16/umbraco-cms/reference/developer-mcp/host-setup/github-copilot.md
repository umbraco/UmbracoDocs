Don't forget to replace the UMBRACO_CLIENT_ID, UMBRACO_CLIENT_SECRET, and UMBRACO_BASE_URL values with your local connection details.

## Getting started

Once youâ€™ve added your MCP Server and updated the JSON configuration, restartins and managing the server is simple.

{% hint style="info" %}
Restarting the MCP Server applies any configuration or tool changes immediately without needing to reinstall or re-add the server.
{% endhint %}

From here, you should [choose which tools or tool collections](../mcp-toolkit.md) you want to enable for your first task.
