# Webhooks

Webhooks provide real-time, event-driven communication within Umbraco. They enable external services to react to content changes instantly by sending HTTP requests when specific events occur. This allows you to integrate with third-party services, automate workflows, and synchronize data effortlessly.

## Getting Started

To manage webhooks, navigate to **Settings > Webhooks** in the Umbraco backoffice.

![Webhooks section](images/webhook-section-v14.png)

To create a webhook, click **Create**. This opens the webhook creation screen where you can configure the necessary details.

## Configuring a Webhook

### URL

The `Url` is the endpoint where the webhook will send an HTTP request when the selected event is triggered. Ensure this endpoint is publicly accessible and capable of handling incoming requests.

### Events

Webhooks are triggered by specific events in Umbraco. By default, the following events are available:

| Event Name         | Description                                      |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Content Published | Fires when content is published.                |
| Content Unpublished | Fires when content is unpublished.            |
| Content Deleted   | Fires when content is deleted.                   |
| Media Deleted     | Fires when a media item is deleted.              |
| Media Saved       | Fires when a media item is saved.                |

### Content Type Filtering

For **Content** or **Media** events, you can specify whether the webhook should trigger for all content types or only specific ones. This is useful when you only need webhooks for certain document types, such as blog posts or products.

### Custom Headers

You can define custom HTTP headers that will be included in the webhook request. Common use cases include:

- Specifying request format: `Accept: application/json`
- Adding authentication tokens: `Authorization: Bearer <your-token>`
- Including security headers

## Default Behavior of Umbraco Webhooks

Umbraco webhooks come with predefined settings and behaviors.

### JSON Payload

Each webhook event sends a JSON payload. For example, the `Content Published` event includes full content details:

```json
{
  "Name": "Root",
  "CreateDate": "2023-12-11T12:02:38.9979314",
  "UpdateDate": "2023-12-11T12:02:38.9979314",
  "Route": {
    "Path": "/",
    "StartItem": {
      "Id": "c1922956-7855-4fa0-8f2c-7af149a92135",
      "Path": "root"
    }
  },
  "Id": "c1922956-7855-4fa0-8f2c-7af149a92135",
  "ContentType": "root",
  "Properties": {}
}
```

The `Content Deleted` event sends only the content ID:

```json
{
  "Id": "c1922956-7855-4fa0-8f2c-7af149a92135"
}
```

### Default Headers

Webhook requests include the following headers by default:

| Header Name | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `user-agent: Umbraco-Cms/{version}` | Identifies the Umbraco version sending the webhook. |
| `umb-webhook-retrycount: {number}` | Indicates the retry count for a webhook request. |
| `umb-webhook-event: {event}` | Specifies the event that triggered the request. Example: `umb-webhook-event: Umbraco.ContentPublished`. |

## Extending Webhooks

### Adding Custom Events

You can extend the list of webhook events using `IUmbracoBuilder` and `IComposer`. Here’s an example of how to add custom webhook events:

```csharp
using Umbraco.Cms.Core.Composing;

public class CustomWebhookComposer : IComposer
{
    public void Compose(IUmbracoBuilder builder)
    {
        builder.WebhookEvents()
            .Clear()
            .AddCms(cmsBuilder =>
            {
                // Add custom events
                cmsBuilder
                    .AddDefault()
                    .AddContent()
                    .AddContentType()
                    .AddDataType()
                    .AddDictionary()
                    .AddDomain()
                    .AddFile()
                    .AddHealthCheck()
                    .AddLanguage()
                    .AddMedia()
                    .AddMember()
                    .AddPackage()
                    .AddPublicAccess()
                    .AddRelation()
                    .AddRelationType()
                    .AddUser();
            });
    }
}
```

To enable all available events, use:

```csharp
builder.WebhookEvents().Clear().AddCms(false);
```

### Replacing Webhook Events

You can modify existing webhook events, such as changing the payload format, by creating a custom implementation:

```csharp
[WebhookEvent("Content Published", Constants.WebhookEvents.Types.Content)]
public class MyCustomContentPublishedWebhookEvent : WebhookEventContentBase<ContentPublishedNotification, IContent>
{
    private readonly IPublishedSnapshotAccessor _publishedSnapshotAccessor;
    private readonly IApiContentBuilder _apiContentBuilder;

    public MyCustomContentPublishedWebhookEvent(
        IWebhookFiringService webhookFiringService,
        IWebhookService webhookService,
        IOptionsMonitor<WebhookSettings> webhookSettings,
        IServerRoleAccessor serverRoleAccessor,
        IPublishedSnapshotAccessor publishedSnapshotAccessor,
        IApiContentBuilder apiContentBuilder)
        : base(webhookFiringService, webhookService, webhookSettings, serverRoleAccessor)
    {
        _publishedSnapshotAccessor = publishedSnapshotAccessor;
        _apiContentBuilder = apiContentBuilder;
    }

    public override string Alias => "Umbraco.ContentPublish";
    protected override IEnumerable<IContent> GetEntitiesFromNotification(ContentPublishedNotification notification) => notification.PublishedEntities;

    protected override object? ConvertEntityToRequestPayload(IContent entity)
    {
        if (_publishedSnapshotAccessor.TryGetPublishedSnapshot(out IPublishedSnapshot? publishedSnapshot) is false || publishedSnapshot!.Content is null)
        {
            return null;
        }

        IPublishedContent? publishedContent = publishedSnapshot.Content.GetById(entity.Key);

        return new
        {
            CustomData = "Your data",
            PublishedContent = publishedContent is null ? null : _apiContentBuilder.Build(publishedContent)
        };
    }
}
```

To replace the default Umbraco webhook with your custom implementation:

```csharp
public class MyComposer : IComposer
{
    public void Compose(IUmbracoBuilder builder)
    {
        builder.WebhookEvents().Replace<ContentPublishedWebhookEvent, MyCustomContentPublishedWebhookEvent>();
    }
}
```

## Webhook Settings

Webhook settings are configured in `appsettings.*.json` under `Umbraco::CMS`:

```json
"Umbraco": {
  "CMS": {
    "Webhook": {
      "Enabled": true,
      "MaximumRetries": 5,
      "Period": "00:00:10",
      "EnableLoggingCleanup": true,
      "KeepLogsForDays": 30
    }
  }
}
```

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `Enabled` | Enables or disables webhooks. |
| `MaximumRetries` | Sets the maximum number of retry attempts. |
| `Period` | Defines the retry interval. |
| `EnableLoggingCleanup` | Enables automatic cleanup of logs. |
| `KeepLogsForDays` | Determines how long webhook logs are retained. |

## Testing Webhooks
