The `UMB_SESSION` cookie is secure if you are using HTTPS pages. However, if you wish to secure the cookie in your code, add the following in the `Program.cs` file after `Build();`

```cs
builder.Services.AddSession(options =>
    {
        options.Cookie.Name = "UMB_SESSION";
        options.Cookie.HttpOnly = true;
        options.Cookie.SecurePolicy = CookieSecurePolicy.Always;
    });
```

For information on the rest of the cookies, see the [Constants-Web.cs](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco-CMS/blob/contrib/src/Umbraco.Core/Constants-Web.cs) file on GitHub.
