# Property Editors

A Property Editor is the editor that a Data Type references. A Data Type is defined by a user in the Umbraco backoffice and references a Property Editor. In Umbraco a Property Editor is defined in a JSON manifest file and associated JavaScript files.

**Are you looking for the Grid Layout or Nested Content?**

The following Property Editors have been removed with the release of Umbraco 14:

* Grid Layout
* Nested content

We recommend using the [Block Editor](built-in-umbraco-property-editors/block-editor/) or the [Rich Text Editor Blocks](built-in-umbraco-property-editors/rich-text-editor/blocks.md) instead.
{% endhint %}

When creating a Data Type, specify the property editor for the Data Type to use by selecting from the "Property editor" list (as shown below).
