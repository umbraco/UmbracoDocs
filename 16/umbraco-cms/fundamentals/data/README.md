# Data

_This section focuses on how to create data using the Umbraco backoffice._

There are three kinds of content in Umbraco:

* Your normal website content exists in the content section.
* Media content such as images, videos, and PDFs are stored in the Media section.
* Finally, Members, are used for user profiles and frontend authentication which you can find in the Members section.

A fundamental principle in Umbraco is that all content types have a definition (Document Types, Media Types, Member Types). These definitions are highly customizable, meaning you can add properties and have complete control over how the data is organized.

## [Defining Content](defining-content/)

## [Creating Media](creating-media/)

## [Customizing Data Types](data-types/)
