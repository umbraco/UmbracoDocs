```

3. Create a new project:

```bash
dotnet new umbraco --name MyProject
```

4. Navigate to the newly created project folder. It will be the folder containing the `.csproj` file:

```bash
cd MyProject
```

5. Build and run the newly created Umbraco site:

We recommend setting up a developer certificate and running the website under HTTPS. If that has not yet been configured, run the following command:

```console
dotnet dev-certs https --trust
```
{% endhint %}

7. Open your browser and navigate to that URL.
8. Follow the instructions to finish up the installation of Umbraco.
