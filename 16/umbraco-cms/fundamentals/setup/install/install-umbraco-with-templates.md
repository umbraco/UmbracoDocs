# Install using .NET CLI

We have made custom Umbraco templates that are available for use with `dotnet new`. The steps below will demonstrate the minimum amount of actions required to get you going and set up an Umbraco project from the command line using .NET templates.

## Install the template

1. Install the latest [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).
2. Run `dotnet new install Umbraco.Templates` to install the project templates.
  _The solution is packaged up into the NuGet package [Umbraco.Templates](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Umbraco.Templates) and can be installed into the dotnet CLI_.

```cli
Templates                    Short Name               Language          Tags
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Umbraco Project              umbraco                  [C#]              Web/CMS/Umbraco
Umbraco Extension            umbraco-extension        [C#]              Web/CMS/Umbraco/Extension/Plugin/Razor Class Library
Umbraco Docker Compose       umbraco-compose                            Web/CMS/Umbraco
```

{% hint style="info" %}
In some cases the templates may silently fail to install (usually this is an issue with NuGet sources). If this occurs you can try specifying the NuGet source in the command by running `dotnet new install Umbraco.Templates --nuget-source "https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json"`.
{% endhint %}

To get **help** on a project template with `dotnet new` run the following command:

`dotnet new umbraco -h`

From that command's output, you will get a better understanding of what are the default template options, as well as those command-line flags specific to Umbraco that you can use (as seen below):

## Create an Umbraco project

1. Create a new empty Umbraco solution:\
   `dotnet new umbraco -n MyCustomUmbracoProject`

You will now have a new project with the name _MyCustomUmbracoProject_, or the name you chose to use. The new project can be opened and run using your favorite IDE or you can continue using the CLI commands.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you want to create a solution file as well you can run the commands below.\
`dotnet new sln`\
`dotnet sln add MyCustomUmbracoProject`
{% endhint %}

## Run Umbraco

1. Navigate to the newly created project folder:\
   `cd MyCustomUmbracoProject`
2. Build and run the new Umbraco .Net Core project:\
   `dotnet build`\
   `dotnet run`

The project is now running on the [Kestrel server](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/servers/?view=aspnetcore-5.0\&tabs=windows#kestrel) and has assigned a free available port to run it on. Look in the terminal window after the `dotnet run` command to see the URLs.

The next step is to run through the Umbraco CMS installation. If you chose to use MS SQL Server/Azure you will need to add your connection string during this setup process to get access to the Umbraco backoffice.
