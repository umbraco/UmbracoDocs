## Create a new Umbraco project

To install Umbraco we first need to install Umbraco's dotnet new templates.

For more information check the first 2 steps of [Install Umbraco with .NET CLI](install-umbraco-with-templates.md#install-the-template).

### Create the Visual Studio project

Go to **File > New > Project** and search for `Umbraco` in the _Search for templates_ field.

Once you select **Umbraco Project (Umbraco HQ)** navigate to the next step by clicking _Next_.

### Configure project

In this step, you will be able to give your project a name specific to the project you are creating.

{% hint style="info" %}
Refrain from changing the Solution name, as this will cause a namespace conflict with the CMS itself.
{% endhint %}

### Additional information

In the next step, you are able to specify some additional parameters like the _Target framework_. The rest are optional.

You can then click the _Create_ button and your Umbraco Project will be ready for you.
