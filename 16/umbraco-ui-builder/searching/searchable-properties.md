# Searchable Properties

Searchable properties allow you to define any `String` based properties in a model. It can be searched via Umbraco UI Builder's list view and entity picker search controls.

Both direct `String` properties and `String` properties within nested objects can be made searchable, provided the parent object is not `null`.

## Defining Searchable Properties

### Using `AddSearchableProperty()` Method

Use `AddSearchableProperty` to specify which properties should be included in search functionality.

#### Method Syntax

```cs
AddSearchableProperty(Lambda searchablePropertyExpression) : CollectionConfigBuilder<TEntityType>
```

#### Example

````cs
collectionConfig.AddSearchableProperty(p => p.FirstName);
collectionConfig.AddSearchableProperty(p => p.Address.Street);
````

## Search Expression Pattern

The search behavior differs based on the version:

- Up to version 15.0.1: Search uses the `StartsWith` method, meaning results include entries that begin with the search term.
- Version 15.0.1 and later: Search can be configured to use `Contains`, allowing results that include the search term anywhere within the property value.

### Example

````csharp
collectionConfig.AddSearchableProperty(p => p.FirstName); // will search for keywords that start with.
collectionConfig.AddSearchableProperty(p => p.FirstName, SearchExpressionPattern.Contains); // will search for keywords that are contained.
````
