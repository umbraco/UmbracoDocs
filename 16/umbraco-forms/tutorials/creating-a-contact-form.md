## Step 1: Configure the Document Types

The first step in this tutorial is to configure the Document Types that will be used to show the Contact Form on your website.

### Creating a Composition

We'll start off by creating a Composition. A Composition is a stand-alone Document Type, that you can reuse on other Document Types. By creating a Composition, we are not duplicating the same properties on multiple Document Types. This is helpful when we want to use the same set of properties on multiple Document Types.

To create a Composition, follow these steps:

1. Go to **Settings** in the Umbraco Backoffice.
2. Expand the **Document Types** folder in the **Settings** tree.
3. Select **...** next to the **Compositions** folder.
4. Click **Create**.
5. Select **Document Type**.
6. Enter a **Name** for the **Composition**- let's call it _Title Box_.
7.  Add the following fields with the respective specifications:

    | Group     | Field Name | Alias    | Data Type  |
    | --------- | ---------- | -------- | ---------- |
    | Title Box | Title      | title    | Textstring |
    | Title Box | Subtitle   | subtitle | Textarea   |
8.  Click **Save** to save the Composition.

### Creating a Contact Us Document Type with Template

Next, we will create a Document type with template. A Document Type contains different properties for holding different types of content. The Document Type we create here will be the one used for creating the content page that will hold our Contact Form.

To create a **Contact Us** Document Type, follow these steps:

1. Go to **Settings** in the Umbraco Backoffice.
2. Select **...** next to the **Document Types** folder.
3. Click **Create**.
4. Select **Document Type with Template**.
5. Enter a **Name** for the **Document Type**- let's call it _Contact Us_.
6. Select **Compositions** in the top-right corner.
7. Select **Title Box**.
8. Click **Submit**.
9.  Add the following fields with the respective specifications:

    | Group   | Field Name   | Alias       | Data Type       |
    | ------- | ------------ | ----------- | --------------- |
    | Form    | Contact Form | contactForm | Form Picker     |
    | Content | Body Text    | bodyText    | Richtext Editor |
10. Click **Save**.

### Updating the Document Type Permission

In the following we will update the Document Type permissions to specifically add child nodes under the root content node.

To update the **Contact Us** Document Type permissions, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the Document Type used for the root content node on your website, in this case **Home** page.
2. Go to the **Structure** tab.
3. Select **Choose** in the **Allowed child node types** section.
4.  Select the **Contact Us** page.

    ![Update Home Page Document Type Properties](images/update-doc-type-permissions-v14.png)
5. Click **Choose**.
6. Click **Save**.

## Step 2: Prepare the Content Node

This step takes you through creating the content node for your Contact Form. The content node uses the Document Type and Template to serve up an HTML page to web visitors.

To add the content node, follow these steps:

1. Go to **Content** in the Umbraco Backoffice.
2. Select **...** next to the **Home Page**.
3. Click **Create**.
4. Select **Contact Us**.
5. Enter the name for the content node. let's call it _Contact Us_.
6.  Enter a **Title**, **Subtitle**, and **Body Text** value. These can always be updated at a later point.

7. Click **Save** or **Save and Publish**.

7. Click **Save** or **Save and Publish**.

## Step 5: Additional configuration

In the next couple of steps, we will add some additional configuration required in order for our form to work properly.

### Configuring the reCAPTCHA value

You need to update the configuration to include a value in the `appsettings.json` file.

To configure the reCAPTCHA value, see the [reCAPTCHA configuration](../developer/configuration/#recaptcha-v2-field-type-configuration) article.

### Configuring Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)

By adding the SMTP settings in the `appsettings.json` file, you can send out emails from your Umbraco installation. It is required in order for your form to be able to send emails on submission.

To configure the SMTP settings, see the [Global Settings](https://docs.umbraco.com/umbraco-cms/reference/configuration/globalsettings#smtp-settings) article.

## Step 6: Rendering the Contact Form

In this step, we will render the values of the Contact Us Document Type in the template.

To render the Contact Form, follow these steps:

1. Go to the **Settings** section in the Umbraco Backoffice.
2. Open the **Contact Us** template in the **Templates** folder.
3.  Enter the following code to render the form:

    ```cs
    @using Umbraco.Forms.Web.Helpers;
    @await Component.InvokeAsync("RenderForm", new { formId = Guid.Parse("<form guid>"), FormTheme = "bootstrap3-horizontal", ExcludeScripts = "1" })
    ```

{% hint style="info" %}
```
Replace **<form guid>** with the ID of your form. You can find the ID in the Form's **Info** tab.
```
{% endhint %}

4. Select **Insert**.
5. Click **Value**.
6. Select **Document Type** from the **Choose field** dropdown.
7. Select **Contact Us**.
8. Click **Choose**.
9. Select **bodyText** from the **Contact Us** dropdown.
10. Click **Submit**.
11. Click **Save**.

{% hint style="info" %}
For Umbraco Forms to work correctly, you need to include some client dependencies. For more information, see the [Preparing Your Frontend](../developer/prepping-frontend.md) article.
{% endhint %}

## The final result

Finally, it is time to view the Contact Form on the frontend.

To view the Contact Form on the Frontend, follow these steps:

1. Go to the **Content** section in the Umbraco Backoffice.
2. Open the **Contact Us** Page.
3. Ensure that the page is published.
4. Go to the **Info** tab.
5. Click on the Published link in the **Links** section.

You now have a full-fledged Contact Form ready to be used on your website.
