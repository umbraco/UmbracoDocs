# Creating websites

In this section, you will find information about which frameworks, languages, and platforms work best with Umbraco to create user-friendly, responsive websites.

Before diving in, it’s helpful to familiarize yourself with some key concepts. This section introduces these concepts and explains how they are used in the Umbraco backoffice.

## How Umbraco Works

Your website’s content is structured using **Document Types**, which define the types of content you can create. Each Document Type is composed of Properties, which utilize **Data Types** to define the type of data that can be entered. Every Data Type relies on a **Property Editor**, which determines how content is edited in the backoffice.

Once content is created using Document Types, it is displayed on your website through **Templates**.

### Key Terminology

There are a lot of terminologies here. Let's look at breaking these terms down:

* [**Document Types**](https://docs.umbraco.com/umbraco-cms/fundamentals/data/defining-content)**:** Define the structure and type of content on your website.
* [**Data Types**](https://docs.umbraco.com/umbraco-cms/fundamentals/data/data-types)**:** Specify the kind of data a Property can store (for example, text, number, date).
* [**Property Editors**](https://docs.umbraco.com/umbraco-cms/13.latest/fundamentals/backoffice/property-editors/built-in-umbraco-property-editors)**:** Control how content is entered and displayed in the backoffice.
* [**Templates**](https://docs.umbraco.com/umbraco-cms/fundamentals/design/templates)**:** Determine how content is rendered on the front end of your website.
