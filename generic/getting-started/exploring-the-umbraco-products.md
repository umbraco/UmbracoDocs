## 1. Getting Started with Umbraco CMS

## 2. Choosing Hosting: Umbraco Cloud vs. On-Premise

* [Umbraco Cloud](exploring-the-umbraco-products.md#umbraco-cloud)
* [On-Premise Hosting](exploring-the-umbraco-products.md#on-premise-hosting)

### Umbraco Cloud

## 3. Discover Headless Possibilities

Ready to deliver content beyond a traditional website? Umbraco offers flexible _headless_ capabilities, decoupling your content management from the frontend presentation. This allows you to manage content once and deliver it to mobile apps, smart devices, or modern frameworks.

### The Content Delivery API (Built-in)

For most headless needs, you can use the native Content Delivery API included in Umbraco CMS. It allows you to serve your content as high-performance JSON without leaving the Umbraco ecosystem. It is best for Hybrid projects (website and apps) or developers who want to stay on the standard Umbraco platform while using modern frontend technology.

### Umbraco Heartcore (Pure SaaS Headless)

If you require a specialized, fully managed Headless-as-a-Service solution, Umbraco Heartcore is the answer. It is a SaaS-only version of Umbraco that removes the frontend entirely, providing managed REST and GraphQL APIs, an integrated CDN (Cloudflare), and automatic updates. It is best for projects that are completely headless and require a managed infrastructure without the need for .NET development.

## 5. Orchestrate Content from Multiple Sources with Umbraco Compose

As your digital ecosystem grows, you may find yourself pulling data from many different places. Umbraco Compose is a SaaS orchestration layer that simplifies this complexity. It connects data from various sources, such as product information management (PIM) systems, customer relationship management (CRM) platforms, enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, and more, into a unified, high-performance GraphQL API.

### How Compose Enhances the Experience

While Umbraco CMS handles your website content, Compose handles the integration layer between your various business systems. It enables a clean, composable architecture without building custom integrations for every external tool.

* **For Content Editors:** Use the Umbraco Content Picker to reference data from any connected system (such as product specifications or customer data) directly within the Umbraco backoffice, creating a seamless editorial experience.
* **For Developers:** Deliver unified content to any frontend, websites, mobile apps, digital kiosks, or other channels using standardized GraphQL endpoints. This reduces technical debt and eliminates complex integration logic in frontend code.

Watch this video for a high-level overview of how Umbraco Compose functions as a content orchestration layer to simplify complex architectures:

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/fgc8w85hbP0?si=GCwJtzKO3h01uTeO" %}

### Subscription

Compose is a subscription-based SaaS product. Pricing is based on your specific needs, including ingestion volume and architectural complexity. This allows organizations to scale their content orchestration as their technology stack grows. Contact the Umbraco sales team for pricing information.

### Use Case Example

Consider a retail organization with product data in a PIM system, marketing content in Umbraco CMS, and customer profiles in a CRM. Using Umbraco Compose, they can:

* Map and normalize product catalogs, marketing content, and CRM data into a unified schema.
* Enable editors to build rich product pages by selecting PIM data directly in the CMS.
* Deliver consistent, real-time information through GraphQL APIs to their e-commerce site, mobile app, and in-store displays.
* Maintain data consistency across all channels without building and maintaining dozens of point-to-point integrations.

By leveraging Compose, organizations reduce integration complexity, accelerate development, and deliver consistent experiences across all digital touchpoints.
