## Invoices

Once you have logged in you can see an overview of your account where you will be able to find your [Order History](https://shop.umbraco.com/profile/options/order-history/). It is in this section you are able to see all your invoices.

## Changing your Credit Card information

If you have to change your credit card information you can do that under [Manage Subscriptions](https://shop.umbraco.com/profile/options/manage-subscriptions/). When changing your credit card information you will have to change the information on all subscriptions where the credit card is being used.

## How to change ownership of subscriptions and projects

You might find yourself in a situation where you will need to change the ownerships of subscriptions or projects. That can be done in the following ways.

### Subscriptions

Changing subscription ownerships is not something you can do by yourself. You will need to reach out to our __Support Team__ and they will do it for you.

:::note
Do note that it will have to be the owner of the subscription who reaches out when changing the owner.

### Projects

Handing over a project to someone else can be done by [adding them to the project as a Team Member](../Team-Members) from the portal. Make sure that you grant them admin rights when adding them so they have full control over the project. When they have been added they can remove you from the project.

:::note
If your client would like to be listed as the creator __they__ will need to create the project. It cannot be changed afterwards.
