# Best Practice Goals for Backend Developers

Below you can find a summary of subjects and areas to look into:
<table data-view="cards">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
    <td><strong>Async</strong></td><td>Utilizing asynchronous calls, often referred to as "fire and forget", presents substantial benefits from the perspective of sustainable systems design.</td><td><a href="../assets/controllers-image.png">controllers-image.png</a></td>
    <td><a href="async.md">Async</a></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Background Tasks</strong></td>
      <td>Implementing background tasks or batching up requests to run in sustainable cloud regions and during off-peak hours of power consumption is a commendable sustainable system design practice.</td><td><a href="../assets/code-image.png">code-image.png</a></td><td><a href="background-tasks.md">Background Tasks</a></td>
    </tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Cache Responses</strong></td><td>Caching in backend development plays a pivotal role in sustainable system design reducing the need for repeated processing and resource-intensive database queries.</td><td><a href="../assets/dashboards-image.png">dashboards-image.png</a></td><td><a href="cache-responses.md">Cache responses</a></td></tr>
   <tr><td><strong>Common Pitfalls</strong></td><td>Conducting thorough performance testing and optimization of backend services holds great merit from the standpoint of sustainable system design.</td><td><a href="../assets/dashboards-image.png">dashboards-image.png</a></td><td><a href="common-pitfalls.md">Common Pitfalls</a></td></tr>
  <tr><td><strong>Jam Stack</strong></td><td>The adoption of JAMstack architecture, Static Site Generation (SSG), and Content Delivery Network (CDN) distribution stands as a commendable choice for sustainable system design.</td><td><a href="../assets/controllers-image.png">controllers-image.png</a></td><td><a href="jamstack.md">Jam Stack</a></td></tr>
  <tr><td><strong>Monolithic vs. Service</strong></td><td>When assessing the sustainability of architectural choices, the distinction between monolithic and service-based architectures takes center stage.</td><td><a href="../assets/dashboards-image.png">dashboards-image.png</a></td><td><a href="monolithic-vs-service.md">Monolithic vs. Service</a></td></tr>
