# Data Management

### Only Collect necessary data
* Action: Review forms and only ask for essential information.
* Why: Less data means less storage and energy use, plus it's GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)-friendly.

### Clean Up Inactive Members and Mailing Lists
* Action: Regularly remove users who haven't logged in for 365 days and prune mailing lists based on engagement.
* Why: It improves email deliverability and reduces storage needs.
