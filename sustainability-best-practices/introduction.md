# Why Sustainability

As a global society we are [not on track with any of the necessary changes](https://climateactiontracker.org/publications/state-of-climate-action-2022/). It's needed to keep global temperature increases below 1.5C compared to pre-industrialised times. That temperature is likely to be breached in 2023 with the additional impact of the warming weather pattern, El Nino. 

The severe disruption to society will also extend to business with physical and digital infrastructure suffering damage, affecting employee’s ability to work. 

The [2023 Edelman Trust Barometer found that business is the most trusted institution](https://www.edelman.com/trust/2023/trust-barometer#:~:text=Great%20expectations%20result%20in%20heightened%20risk%20for%20business), above NGOs, governments and media. Therefore, it is vital for businesses to live up to that on issues like the climate and ecological emergencies.

Organisations in the digital industry have a part to play in meeting the challenge of reducing emissions. 

* [The emissions caused by the digital industry are equivalent to the airline industry](https://www.cell.com/patterns/pdfExtended/S2666-3899(21)00188-4). 
* Since the Paris Agreement, [average web page size has increased by 64% on desktop and 132% on mobile](https://httparchive.org/reports/page-weight?start=2015_12_01&end=latest&view=list). 
* This is exacerbated by the fact that more people are consuming heavier weight software; [internet users have increased 60%, whilst internet traffic has increased by 440%](https://www.iea.org/energy-system/buildings/data-centres-and-data-transmission-networks).

Given the above, this documentation-site describes some of the the best practices that can be applied when developing digital experiences. The recommendations are given by a group of Umbraco Community members organized in [the Sustainability Team](https://umbraco.com/blog/meet-the-new-community-sustainability-team/).
