#Buying and configuring a license
Since Umbraco Forms is a commercial product you'll need to have a valid license file in order for it to fully work.

If your Umbraco Forms installation is still in trial you should see the following notification on the Forms dashboard

##Buying a license
Licenses for Umbraco Forms can be purchased on http://umbraco.com. So if you hit the *buy license* button you'll be redirected to the umbraco.com website and are able to buy a license in the webshop. 

##Configuring a license
You can either download your license from the umbraco.com website and place it in the /bin directory of your site manually or you can use the *configure existing license* option on the Forms dashboard (please not that you'll need to have your umbraco.com account details in order to fetch the license)

##Licensing model
Licenses are sold per domain and will also work on all subdomains. You'll also get 2 development domains.
So a full license could like like

- *.mysite.com
- *.mydevdomain.com
- *.myotherdevdomain.com

Only 1 license can exist per Umbraco instance, if you wish to extend a license with additional domains that option is also possible on http://umbraco.com
