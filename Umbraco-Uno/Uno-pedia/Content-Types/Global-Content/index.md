# The Global Content

Global Content is a way for you to create widgets that you will then later be able to use on other pages via the [Global Content Widget](../../Widgets/Global-Content).

When you have created a widget here it will work as a template in the future, so that you will only have to set it up once, saving you a lot of time in the future.

Setting your widgets up with this feature ensures that every time you make a new page, you can get the same design on each page.
All you will need to do is add them in the Global Content widget, making it straight forward to keep the same design on all of your pages.

## Setting up Global Content

### Global Content

If you Selected Global Content, follow these steps to create widgets:

- When you press **Add Content** a window will pop up where you can select what widget you want to work with (you can select multiple widgets)
- Select and configure the widget(s) you want to use
- You set them up like you would do normally, the only difference here is that they will be marked as Global Content

Doing this, you will now have a set of pre-setup widgets, which you can then use on multiple pages of your site.
