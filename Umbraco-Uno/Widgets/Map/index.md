The Map Widget is a feature that lets you use Google Maps to show the location of your choice, this could be if you need to show where your company is located.

The way it works is that you type in the ***Latitude*** and ***Longitude*** and select how zoomed in you want the map to be on a scale from 0 - 20 with 7 being default.
