# Tours settings

The tours section is a section that only contains one value `"EnableTours"` which allows you to enable or disable tours, by default tours are enabled. If you wish to disable tours set the `"EnableTours"` to false, like so:

```json
"Umbraco": {
  "CMS": {
    "Tours": {
      "EnableTours": false
    }
  }
}
```
