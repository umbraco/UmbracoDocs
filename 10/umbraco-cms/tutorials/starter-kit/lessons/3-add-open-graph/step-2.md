# Add Open Graph - Step 2

We will now add the group and properties to the Home page and Blog post of the site.

This is done by using compositions to add the functionality in multiple places.

1. In the **Settings** section, expand the Document Type tree.
2. Open the `Home` Document Type and select **Compositions...** in the top-right.
3. Choose the `Open Graph` Document Type we created and *Submit*.
4. **Save** the Document Type.

This will add the group and properties from the **Open Graph** Document Type to the **Home** Document Type. Follow the same steps for the `Blogpost` Document Type.

## Reviewing the changes

If you go to the content section and select Home you can now see your changes (the same goes for the blog posts).
