# Working with Media Types

The following default Media Types are available:

* Article - Used for uploading and storing documents.
* Audio - used for uploading and storing digital audio files.
* File - used for uploading and storing different types of files in the Media section.
* Folder - a container for organizing media items in the media tree.
* Image - used for uploading and storing images.
* Vector Graphics (SVG) - used for uploading and storing Scalable Vector Graphics files which are text files containing source code to draw the desired image.
* Video - used for uploading and storing video files.

## Uploading a Media Item

In the Media Library, there are multiple ways to upload media items. The two most commonly used ones are:

1. Use the **Create** button to create a new media item and then upload directly from your machine.
2.  The **Upload** field is available in every folder in the Media section, where you can drag and drop files or choose files to the desired location.

We recommend using folders to organize your media items if you are going to add a lot of media to your website.
