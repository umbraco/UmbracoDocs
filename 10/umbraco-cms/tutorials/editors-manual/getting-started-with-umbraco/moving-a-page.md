# Moving a Page

Move pages within the website through the tree view. Not all pages can be moved depending on your set-up or page permissions. If you need clarification, contact your system administrator.

You can move a page in two ways:

## Option 1

1. Go to **Content**.
2.  Right-click the page you wish to move and select **Move**. Alternatively, click **•••** next to the parent node, select **Do something else** and click **Move**.
