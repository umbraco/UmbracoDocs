## Adding Culture and Hostnames to the root node of the website

To add culture and hostnames, follow these steps:

4. Click **Save**.

## Adding Language Variants to the Content

You will find a language dropdown above your content tree. If it's not there, you might need to refresh the page:

![Language of Content Tree](images/language-content-tree.png)

In the language dropdown, you will find all the languages that you have installed for your site. You can switch between them to update the content variations for each language.

To add language variants to the content, follow these steps:

1.  Go to the **Home Page** node. You will find a language dropdown next to the title at the top:

    ![Language Variant dropdown](images/language-dropdown.png)
2.  Click the dropdown and hover over the new language. You will see an **Open in Splitview** option will appear.

    ![Open Language in Splitview](images/open-in-splitview.png)
3.  Click **Open in Splitview**. In this splitview, we can see the content node with each language side by side.

    You may notice that the bodytext is greyed out - this is because we haven't checked the **Allow vary by culture** checkbox.

4. Enter the **Name** for your content node and the **Page Title** in the new language.
5.  Click **Save and Publish**. The **Ready to Publish** window opens providing the option to publish in one or more languages.
