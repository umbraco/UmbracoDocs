Umbraco Deploy is also the engine that runs behind the scenes on [Umbraco Cloud](https://docs.umbraco.com/umbraco-cloud/). Here it takes care of all the deployment processes of both code, schema and content on projects.

With Umbraco Deploy you get to use the Umbraco Cloud Deployment technology outside of Umbraco Cloud to ease deployment between multiple Umbraco environments. This is done by connecting external hosted Umbraco projects with a local instance of your Umbraco website.

In the Umbraco Deploy documentation can read all about how to set up and work with Umbraco Deploy.

You can find articles about how to set up Umbraco Deploy on a new or an existing website, and article about the deployment workflow.
