## Predefined allowed File Types

To allow only specific files:

2. Click **Submit**.

{% hint style="info" %}
We recommend selecting **Allow only specified files**, to limit malicious code to be uploaded, whenever the user is submitting the Form.
{% endhint %}

## User Defined Allowed File Types

If the list of predefined file types do not include a specific file type, you can add additional ones.

To add new file type:

1. Type a file extension name in the **User defined allowed file types** field and click add.
2. Click **Submit**.
