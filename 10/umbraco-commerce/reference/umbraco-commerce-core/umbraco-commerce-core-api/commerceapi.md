## CommerceApi

Convenient singleton access to the Umbraco Commerce API

```csharp
public static class CommerceApi
```

**Namespace**
* [Umbraco.Commerce.Core.Api](README.md)

### Properties

#### Instance

Get the [`ICommerceApi`](icommerceapi.md) entry point

```csharp
public static ICommerceApi Instance { get; }
```


**Remarks**

This helper is providing singleton access to the Umbraco Commerce API which generally isn't considered "best practice". You should instead look to resolve the [`ICommerceApi`](icommerceapi.md) via dependency injection where possible, and only resort to this singleton where you have no other option.
