# Cards

Cards provide an API to display basic summary information in a card-based format and are useful for displaying key metrics about a collection.

Cards can be defined in one of two ways:

{% content-ref url="count-cards.md" %}
[Count Cards](count-cards.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="custom-cards.md" %}
[Custom Cards](custom-cards.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
