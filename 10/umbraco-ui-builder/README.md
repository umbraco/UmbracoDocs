# Konstrukt Documentation

Konstrukt is the Umbraco v10+ back office UI builder for custom data structures configured via a fluent API.

![Example Konstrukt UI](/images//comments_listview.png)

If you have a custom data store that you’d like to be able to content manage from within Umbraco then Konstrukt will allow you to quickly configure a custom administration UI, reusing many core components and with a consistent look and feel, in just a few lines of code.

With Konstrukt, custom back office integrations can now take a matter of minutes, rather than days.
