## Steps - Part One
1. In the **Settings** section, expand **Document Types**.
2. Click on *Blogpost*: this is the Document Type that defines the fields for this type of page.
3. On the right side, you can see two tabs called *Content* and *Navigation & SEO*. At the bottom of the *Content* tab click **Add property**.  This opens the **Property Editor** dialog window.
4. Enter a Name of *Publication Date*.
5. Enter a Description of *The date of the blog post. This is the date used to display the most recent posts first.*.  Always try to add a meaningful description to help your editors.
6. Click **Add editor** to specify what type of data is being stored.  We just need a standard date, so select the **Reuse** tab, then click on the **Date Picker** icon.
7. In the validation section tick to say that the field is Mandatory.
8. Click Submit to close the dialog.
9. Click the **Reorder** link near the top right of the pane, then drag the new property to be after *Page Title*.  A logical order to your properties will make things easier for your editors.
10. Click *Save*.  A confirmation message should appear confirming that the Document Type was saved.
