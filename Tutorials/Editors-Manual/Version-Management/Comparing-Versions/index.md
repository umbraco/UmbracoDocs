# Versions

Umbraco allows you to work with multiple versions of the same page. All previously saved pages are stored in a version history list.

You will never lose changes on a page because all the old versions of the page are saved in **History**. You also have the opportunity to access and re-publish older versions if necessary.

## Comparing Versions

To compare a page on the site with its previous versions:

1. Navigate to the page whose versions you wish to view.
2. Go to the **Info** tab.
3. Click on the **Rollback** button in the **History** section.

4. The Rollback tree opens in the right-side of the screen. Select a version from the **Rollback To** drop-down list.

    After selecting the version, a comparison of the current page with the version you selected is displayed. The text highlighted in red and striked-out will not appear in the selected version and the text highlighted in green means the text that will be added, should you choose to rollback to that version of the page.
