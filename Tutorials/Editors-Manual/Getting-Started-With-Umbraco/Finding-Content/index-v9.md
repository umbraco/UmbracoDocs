# Finding Content

The Umbraco content tree view allows you to navigate web pages through a logical site hierarchy. You can find a page by navigating through the tree itself if you know where the page is stored.

## Searching Umbraco

A quicker way to search across all the content, files, or folders in Umbraco is to click the Magnifier icon ![magnifier](images/search-magnifier-v8.png) in the top-right of the screen. Alternatively, you can use the keyboard shortcut **CTRL + SPACE** to access the **Search** bar.

Using the search bar, you can enter a search term and Umbraco will search for pages and media containing the term.
