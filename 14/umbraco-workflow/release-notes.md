## Release History

This section contains the release notes for Umbraco Workflow 14 including all changes for this version.

### [14.1.4](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.Workflow.Issues/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3Arelease%2F14.1.4) (January 16 2025 )
* Fixes workflow task summary generation in email body [#91](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.Workflow.Issues/issues/91)
* Fixes localization in email body
* Updates Umbraco.Licenses dependency
* Refactors migration plan naming to align with the broader DXP product suite.

### 14.1.3 (December 16th 2024)
* Fixes column type mismatch in migration
* Correctly implements delay time in History Cleanup hosted service

### 14.1.2 (November 14th 2024)
* Adds abstraction over `UmbContentWorkspaceContext.readOnlyState` to consistently implement readonly document workspaces.
* Fixes invariant culture handling when unlocking a scheduled document.

### 14.1.1 (November 7th 2024)
* Fixes a bug causing migrations from Workflow 13 to fail on SQL Server.
* Fixes the above exposed a secondary issue where the migration from integer to GUID identifiers was incomplete. This resulted in incorrect relationships between approval groups and tasks in historic Workflow data, and incorrect information displaying the backoffice. 
* Adds SQL query performance improvements.
* Adds loading indicator to Workflow tables in the backoffice.

### [14.1.0](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.Workflow.Issues/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3Arelease%2F14.1.0) (October 23rd 2024 )
* Adds scheduled content locking feature. Documents can be made readonly until the scheduled release date passes, to ensure approved content is not modified without workflow approval. [#84](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.Workflow.Issues/issues/84)
* Adds support for readonly mode when a document is pending workflow approval. Along with the scheduled content lock, this feature requires Umbraco 14.3.0, which is now the minumum version dependency for Umbraco Workflow v14.
* Adds support for content segments. Segment names are displayed when requesting approval and in workflow history [#60](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.Workflow.Issues/issues/60)
* Adds support for Arabic.
* Improves UI in workflow detail overlay. Reduces the number of elements and shifts appropriate data points into tag elements.
* Adds email queue for thread-safe email notifications. Emails are now processed in the hosted service, via a first-in first-out queue. This resolves a reported issue where sending large numbers of emails could result in data reader errors. [#85](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.Workflow.Issues/issues/85)

### [14.0.3](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.Workflow.Issues/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3Arelease%2F14.0.3) (October 3rd 2024)

* Fixes an issue where scheduled workflows did not apply the release/expire date if the content node was already scheduled [#81](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.Workflow.Issues/issues/80)
* Ensure converting integers to strings uses the invariant culture to avoid unexpected formatting
* Fixes an issue related to sending notification emails in sites with a large number of workflow groups [#79](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.Workflow.Issues/issues/79)
