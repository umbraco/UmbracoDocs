## Predefined allowed File Types

You can choose to specify which files you want to allow the user to upload, when accessing the Form.

To allow only specific files:

1. Select the specific File Types the user should be able to upload.
2. Click **Submit**.

{% hint style="info" %}
We recommend selecting only specified files, to limit malicious code to be uploaded, whenever the user is submitting the Form.
{% endhint %}

## User Defined Allowed File Types

If the list of predefined file types does not include a specific file type, you can add additional ones.

To add new file type:

1. Type a file extension name in the **User defined allowed file types** field.
2. Click **+**.
3. Click **Submit**.

## Server-side file validation

The file upload field type will verify the file contents using the registered set of `IFileStreamSecurityValidator` instances.
