### [14.2.0-rc1](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.Forms.Issues/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3Arelease%2F14.2.0) **October 25th 2024**

#### Multi-step forms

The 14.2 release of Forms contains features that can improve the user experience of completing multi-page forms.

We have added the option for [editors to choose to display paging details on the forms](./editor/creating-a-form/form-settings.md#multi-page-forms). This will allow those completing forms to get a better understanding of progress as well as see details of the pages still to be completed. [#281](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.Forms.Issues/issues/281) [#648](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.Forms.Issues/issues/648).

These options are enabled and configured by editors in the Forms settings section on a per-form basis. We also provide a [configuration-based toggle for the feature as a whole](./developer/configuration/README.md#enablemultipageformsettings). In this way, editors can be given access to use the feature only once the styling or theme is prepared.

#### Form picker enhancements

Another improvement is found in the [form picker property editors](./developer/property-editors.md). We now support restriction of which forms can be selected by folder rather than only by individual forms.

A second "form details picker" is also available, allowing editors the option of selecting the form, theme and redirect via a single property editor.

#### Ship themes in Razor Class Libraries

Forms ships it's themes and email templates as part of a razor class library for ease of distribution. With this release we make that feature [available to your own custom themes and templates](./developer/themes.md#shipping-themes-in-a-razor-class-library) (or those created by package developers) [#795](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.Forms.Issues/issues/795).

#### Date picker field type

We have made a couple of updates to the Date Picker field type. The format for the field can now be provided in configuration [#1276](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.Forms.Issues/issues/1276). And you can now override and localize the aria label provided for assistive technologies such as screen readers [#1082](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.Forms.Issues/issues/1082).

#### Umbraco documents prevalue source type

When creating a prevalue source based on Umbraco documents, you can now select custom properties for the value or caption. Previously you had a choice of the content item's `Id`, `Key` or `Name`. We've extended this to allow the selection of any properties defined on the selected Document Type [#1195](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.Forms.Issues/issues/1195).

#### Finer grained entries permissions

To allow finer control over editor permissions, we have introduced a "delete entries" setting for users and user groups. Thus you can now give editors explicit permissions to view, edit, or delete entries [#1303](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.Forms.Issues/issues/1303).

#### Backoffice localization

Finally thanks to a kind contribution from [Erik-Jan Westendorp](https://github.com/erikjanwestendorp) the backoffice is now translated into Dutch [#1264](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.Forms.Issues/issues/1264).

* Reverted entry list to display most recent first.
