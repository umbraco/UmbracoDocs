## Setting Up an Umbraco Project

To set up your Umbraco project, see the [Installation](../../umbraco-cms/fundamentals/setup/install/README.md) article.

## Configuring Umbraco Commerce

To access the **Commerce** section, additional configuration is needed. For detailed steps, see the [Configuration](../getting-started/umbraco-configuration.md) article.

## Accessing the Umbraco Backoffice

You can access the backoffice by adding `/umbraco` at the end of your website URL. For example: `https://mywebsite.com/umbraco`.

## Setting Up a Store

A store is an online platform where products or services are listed for customers to browse, purchase, and complete transactions over the internet.

Setting up a store allows you to manage both the content and commerce aspects of your site. It allows you to create a custom and scalable online shopping experience. For more information, see the [Stores](../reference/stores/README.md) article.

### Setting up a Location

If your business operates in multiple regions, setting up locations helps:

To create an order status:

## Built-in Property Editors

Umbraco Commerce includes default property editors that help manage and configure eCommerce functionalities within the Umbraco backoffice.

![Built-in Property Editors](images/property-editors.png)

The available property editors include:

* **Price:** Used to manage and define product pricing.
* **Store Picker:** Allows selection of a specific store for products or configurations.
* **Store Entity Picker:** Used for selecting entities like products or categories within a store.
* **Stock:** Helps manage stock levels for products.
* **Measurements:** Allows the configuration of product dimensions and weight.
* **Variants Editor:** Used for managing product variants, such as sizes or colors.

## Accessing Store Permissions in Umbraco Commerce

When editing a store in Umbraco Commerce, the **Permissions** tab allows you to control who can access the store's management interface. This ensures that only authorized individuals or user groups can make changes or view store data.

![Store Permissions](images/store-permissions.png)

The Permissions tab contain the following options:

* **User Groups:** You can assign permissions to entire user groups. A toggle is provided to either allow or deny access to specific user groups. This is useful for assigning store management roles to groups like "Store Managers" or "Editors" without setting permissions for individual users.

* **Users:** In addition to groups, you can assign permissions to individual users. This feature lets you grant or deny store access to specific individuals based on their role in the organization. Like the user group settings, toggle allows you to control what each user can access.

{% hint style="info" %}
If both a user group and an individual user have conflicting permissions, the "Allow" control will always take priority. For example: "Deny" at the group level and "Allow" at the user level. This ensures that users explicitly granted access will not be denied by group-level settings.
{% endhint %}

## Conclusion

We have now covered the essential steps to set up Umbraco Commerce - from installation to store configuration.

Umbraco Commerce provides a flexible solution for creating and managing eCommerce websites directly within Umbraco CMS. While this tutorial helps you get started, feel free to explore advanced configurations to extend your store's functionality based on your business needs.
