# Stores

Stores represent a single shop / commercial entity and contain all the settings a configuration specific to that particular store. They are the root entity from which all other Umbraco Commerce entities are connected. They are also able to be linked to content nodes to connect a store to a site.

## Store Configuration

Further store configuration can be achieved by setting up different categories of configuration that can be accessed as child nodes to the store node.

The available configuration options are:

* **Locations** - Defines different locations for a store. See [Locations reference documentation](../locations/README.md) for more details.
* **Order Statuses** - Defines the order statuses to be used by a store.
* **Shipping Methods** - Defines the different shipping options available in the store. See [Shipping reference documentation](../shipping/README.md) for more details.
* **Payment Methods** - Defines the different payment options available in the store.
* **Countries** - Defines the different shipping countries supported by the store.
* **Currencies** - Defines the different currencies accepted by the store.
* **Taxes** - Defines the different rates supported by the store.
* **Templating** - Defines the different email, print, and export templates available to the store.

## Store Permissions

When editing a store, the permissions app allows you to control who can access the store management interface. The options are:

* **User Groups** - A set of toggles to allow/deny access to members of a particular user group.
* **Users** - A set of toggles to allow/deny access to explicit individuals.

In both cases, a positive access control will always override a deny control setting.
