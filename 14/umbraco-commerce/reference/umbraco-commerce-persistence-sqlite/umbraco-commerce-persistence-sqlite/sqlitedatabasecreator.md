```

**Remarks**

With journal_mode = wal we have snapshot isolation.

Concurrent read/write can take occur, committing a write transaction will have no impact on open read transactions as they see only committed data from the point in time that they began reading.

A write transaction still requires exclusive access to database files so concurrent writes are not possible.
