# Bundle

The `bundle` extension type enables you to gather many extension manifests into one.

It points to a single JavaScript file that via JavaScript Modules, exports or re-exports Extension Manifests written in JavaScript.

It can be used as the entry point for a package, or as a grouping for a set of manifests.

## Use Bundle as an entry point for a package

If you want to declare your manifests in JavaScript/TypeScript, the Bundle is a great choice.

The following example shows an `umbraco-package.json` that refers to one bundle, which can then declare manifests.

{% code title="umbraco-package.json" %}

```json
    {
		"name": "My Package Name",
		"version": "1.0.0",
		"extensions": [
			{
				"type": "bundle",
				"alias": "My.Package.Bundle",
				"name": "My Package Bundle",
				"js": "/App_Plugins/my-package/manifests.js"
			}
		]
	}
```

{% endcode %}

{% code title="manifests.ts" %}

```typescript
import type { ManifestTypes } from '@umbraco-cms/backoffice/extension-registry';

export const manifests: Array<ManifestTypes> = [
	{
		type: 'dashboard',
		name: 'Example Dashboard',
		alias: 'example.dashboard.demo',
		element: () => import('./demo-dashboard.js'),
		weight: 900,
		meta: {
			label: 'Demo example',
			pathname: 'demo-example',
		},
	},
	// ... insert as many manifests as you like
]
```

{% endcode %}
