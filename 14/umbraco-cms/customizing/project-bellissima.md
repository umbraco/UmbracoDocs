# Project Bellissima

"Bellissima", the code name for the frontend code of the backoffice, is a re-creation of the backoffice of Umbraco. While replacing the deprecated angular code with [Lit](https://lit.dev/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), you can customize and extend everything in the backoffice.

Each block is an extension point that can be extended, customized, replaced, or removed.

You are not limited to the mentioned frameworks. You can use any other framework or library of your choice.
