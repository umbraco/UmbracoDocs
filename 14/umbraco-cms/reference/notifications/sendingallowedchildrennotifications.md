# Sending Allowed Children Notification

The `SendingAllowedChildrenNotification` is no longer available in Umbraco 14 and no replacement is available for this major version.

Please see [content type filters](../../../../15/umbraco-cms/reference/content-type-filters.md) as the supported alternative in Umbraco 15 for use cases that previously relied on this notification.
