# Macros and Partial View Macros

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Are you looking for documentation about Macros and/or Partial View Macros?

Macros and Partial View Macros have been removed with the release of Umbraco 14.

We recommend using using [Partial Views](../../fundamentals/design/partial-views.md) or [Blocks in the Rich Text Editor](../../fundamentals/backoffice/property-editors/built-in-umbraco-property-editors/rich-text-editor/rte-blocks.md) as a replacement.

Learn more about the decision for remove Macros in the official announcement: [Breaking change: Macros will be removed in Umbraco 14](https://github.com/umbraco/Announcements/issues/14).
