## Content Within the Tree View

When you are looking to edit content, locate the _**page**_ you want to edit in the Content tree on the left-side of the screen.

## View Page Layout

By default, you can view Page layouts in two ways:

1. **List**

   When you enable Collection on a page, there will be no standard tree view for that page. Clicking on the parent page displays the child pages in a list.

2. **Grid**

    You can switch between list and grid view by clicking the ![layout](images/layout.png) icon in the top-right of the screen:
