# Umbraco Forms in the Database

In Umbraco Forms, it is _only_ possible to store Form data in the database.

If you are upgrading to Umbraco 9 and using Forms, you should first migrate the Forms to the database using Forms 8. For more information on migrating your Umbraco Forms data to the database, see the [Umbraco Forms in the Database version 8.0.0+](https://our.umbraco.com/documentation/Add-ons/UmbracoForms/Developer/Forms-in-the-Database/index-v8) article.
