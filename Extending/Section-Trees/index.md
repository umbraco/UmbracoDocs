# Sections & Trees

The Umbraco backoffice consists of sections (sometimes referred to as applications) which contain Trees. 

Each section is identified by an icon in the left-hand side navigation ribbon of the Umbraco Backoffice.

For example, when you load the backoffice you'll see that the 'Content' section contains one tree: the content tree whereas the 'Settings' section contains a number of trees: Stylesheets, Content Types, Media Types, etc...

You can create your own sections and trees to extend Umbraco.
