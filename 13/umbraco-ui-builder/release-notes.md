#### [**13.1.0-rc1**](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.UIBuilder.Issues/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3Arelease%2F13.1.0) **(February 20th 2024)**

Umbraco UI Builder 13.1 is the first release since launch adding new features. We've focussed on improving the experience when working with related collections, addressing some additional use cases that widen the scope of the product. This includes the possibility to retrieve child collections entities or use an Umbraco entity as foreign key.

* Related Collections

This feature provides support for managing **many-to-many** relationships by configuring main, related and junction entities.

You can read more about this in the [related collections](collections/related-collections.md) article.

* Retrieve Child Collections

This feature addresses a **one-to-many** relationship context. Having a parent collection with child sub-collections, one might need to retrieve the child collections only, without fetching the details of the parent.

You can read more about this in the [retrieve child collections](collections/retrieve-child-collections.md) article.

* Implementation of a `UdiConverter`

This update addresses the configuration of collections that use as foreign key a reference to an Umbraco entity. If the FK type is `Integer`, the persisted value defaults to 0. This is because the UDI value of the entity cannot be converted from `String` to `Int`. Based on the UDI value, we are retrieving and persisting the `Id` of the Umbraco entity.

A use case can be found in the [GitHub issue #86](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.UIBuilder.Issues/issues/86).


#### [**13.0.3**](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.UIBuilder.Issues/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3Arelease%2F13.0.3) **(February 20th 2024)**

* Dependency version update for `Umbraco.Licenses`

#### [13.0.2](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.UIBuilder.Issues/issues?q=label%3Arelease%2F13.0.2+is%3Aclosed) (January 26th 2024)

* Doesn't work after upgrading to 13.0.3 [#88](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.UIBuilder.Issues/issues/88)
