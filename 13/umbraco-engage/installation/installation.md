If you have any trouble, please go to [Troubleshooting installs](troubleshooting-installs.md).
{% endhint %}

## Next steps

![Engage section in the Umbraco Backoffice.](<../.gitbook/assets/image (4) (1).png>)

When you have installed Umbraco Engage, build or restart your website, and the **Engage** section will appear in the backoffice, as shown above.

The next step is to [configure a license](licensing.md).

It is recommended to consider the information detailed in the section below, to get the best out of Umbraco Engage.

### Umbraco Forms

If you have installed **Umbraco Forms** as well and want to automatically track submissions of Umbraco Forms. Install the package [Umbraco.Engage.Forms](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Umbraco.Engage.Forms) via NuGet or using your preferred approach as above.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Visual Studio Package Manager" %}
```
PM> install package Umbraco.Engage.Forms
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Console" %}
```console
dotnet add package Umbraco.Engage.Forms
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Clientside tracking

To capture events that happen on the clientside (frontend) of your website, you need to add the [clientside tracking script](../developers/analytics/client-side-events-and-additional-javascript-files/additional-measurements-with-the-analytics-scripts.md). This is done by including the following snippet on all of your pages.

```html
<script src="/Assets/Umbraco.Engage/Scripts/umbracoEngage.analytics.js"></script>
```

{% hint style="info" %}
The following client-side tracking script loading types are currently not supported: "async" or "defer".
{% endhint %}

### Cockpit

Cockpit is a tool to help with testing segments and diagnose the data Umbraco Engage collects. It can be viewed on the frontend of your website, only if you are logged into Umbraco as well.

Install cockpit on your website by adding the following Razor Partial View in your templates in Umbraco before the closing `</body>` tag

```html
@Html.Partial("Umbraco.Engage/Cockpit")</body>
```

Learn more [what Cockpit is and how you can use](../getting-started/for-marketers-and-editors/cockpit.md) it.

### Optional Extras

Here are some optional extras you can do to improve your experience with Umbraco Engage.

* Add a [Google Analytics bridging script](../developers/analytics/client-side-events-and-additional-javascript-files/bridging-library-for-google-analytics.md) that automatically sends events that you send to Google Analytics, to Umbraco Engage as well.

```html
<script src="~/Assets/Umbraco.Engage/Scripts/umbracoEngage.analytics.ga4-bridge.min.js"></script>
```

* Add the [Google Analytics blocker detection script](../developers/analytics/client-side-events-and-additional-javascript-files/google-analytics-blocker-detection.md). This gives you insights in which page traffic Umbraco Engage will track, and Google Analytics will not track.

```html
<script src="/Assets/Umbraco.Engage/Scripts/umbracoEngage.analytics.blockerdetection.js"></script>
```

{% hint style="info" %}
The following Google Analytics bridging or blocker script loading types are currently not supported: "async" or "defer".
{% endhint %}

### Cookie consent

If you need to influence the default [The Umbraco Engage cookie](../marketers-and-editors/introduction/the-umbraco-engage-cookie.md) behaviour please go [here](../security-and-privacy/gdpr/). Or go to an example [implementation using Cookiebot](../security-and-privacy/gdpr/how-to-become-gdpr-compliant-using-cookiebot.md) which can be used as an example for other cookie consent providers.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you [change the default cookie behaviour](../developers/introduction/the-umbraco-engage-cookie/) make sure to perform a **client side reload of the initial page after cookie consent**. If this is not done, visitor referrer and/or campaigns will not be tracked.
{% endhint %}

### Load balancing and CM / CD environments

Are you using a load-balanced setup or separate CM and CD environments? [Please check our documentation about this topic](../getting-started/for-developers/loadbalancing-and-cm-cd-environments.md).

### The first run

When you visit your site locally for the first time, Umbraco Engage will begin tracking page views, visitors, etc. If you go to **Engage** -> **Analytics,** you won't see any data until the first reporting run. By default, reporting data will be generated at 04:00 AM automatically.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Umbraco-Engage-Regenerate-data.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Regenerate button</p></figcaption></figure>

To generate reporting data manually on your local installation, go to **Engage** -> **Configuration.** Scroll down to **Reporting** section and click the red **Regenerate** button.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Use the **Regenerate** button only in non-production environments because it can cause temporary performance degradation.
{% endhint %}
