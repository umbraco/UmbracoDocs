# Google Analytics vs Umbraco Engage

You can see a difference in statistics (Pageviews, Visitors, etc.) between Google Analytics and Umbraco Engage.

Umbraco Engage will collect pageviews unless Google Analytics (GA)/Google Tag Manager (GTM) is blocked or GA/GTM cookies are not accepted. So approx. 10% - 25% more pageviews in Umbraco Engage compared to GA should be considered as normal depending on the audience with the current available information.
