uMS has the following requirements:

* Umbraco version 8.7+, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13.
* SQL Server 2014+, LocalDB, or Azure SQL.
  * **SQL CE & SQLite are not supported.**

{% hint style="info" %}
It is recommended to upgrade your Umbraco installation to the latest version.
{% endhint %}

See the [Troubleshooting](../../../../installing-umarketingsuite/troubleshooting-installs/) section if you need to upgrade from SQL CE to SQL Server.

uMS is compatible with Umbraco Cloud.

Umbraco Deploy is currently not supported for the uMS features.
