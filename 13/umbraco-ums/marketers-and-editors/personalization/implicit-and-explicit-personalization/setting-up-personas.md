# Personas

Here you can create one or more persona groups, and within each group, you can create one or more personas.

## Personas

Personas are an important concept for implicit personalization in the Umbraco uMS. A persona is an archetypical user whose goals, needs, and characteristics represent a group of visitors to your website. By creating personas you can define behavior on your website and personalize the website experience depending on the persona's needs.

Creating personas is something that you should do for your website. If it's your first time coming up with personas we always advise creating a maximum of 3 personas.&#x20;

If you want to add many more personas, be aware that each added persona will increase the complexity of finding good personalization strategies. And every extra persona requires extra content.

In Umbraco uMS we for example have three different personas:

* **The data & privacy officer**. This type of visitor is mainly interested in how Umbraco uMS is safeguarding data storage and GDPR ruling.
* **The developer**. This persona is interested in how to set up Umbraco uMS.
* **The marketer**. This persona is looking for inspiration and functionalities; what has Umbraco uMS to offer.

To learn how you can set up Personas in Umbraco Engage read the [How to create a Persona](../../../tutorials/get-started-with-personas-and-personalization.md) guide.
