   * This is shown in the site navigation menu.
   * If you want a logo instead of the Site Name you can upload and/or choose an image from the Media Library.
6. When you are happy with the changes publish them to the website by clicking the **Save and Publish** button.

To see the changes you've made go to the **Info** tab and click on the link.
