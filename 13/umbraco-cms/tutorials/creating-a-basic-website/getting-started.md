# Getting Started

The **Creating a Basic Site** tutorial provides step-by-step instructions to build an Umbraco website using a set of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. The tutorial allows you to use a website template, customize it, and wire up the sections that need content managing in the Umbraco CMS.

## **What You Need**

To install a basic website in the Umbraco CMS, you need the following:

* [A clean and empty installation of the Umbraco CMS](getting-started.md#installing-umbraco).
* [This tutorial uses a copy of the Custom Umbraco Template – a HTML5, responsive website template](getting-started.md#preparing-the-custom-umbraco-template-site). Download the [Custom Umbraco Template](https://umbra.co/Umbracotemplate) or, if you prefer, you can use your own flat HTML files.

### Installing Umbraco

To download the latest version of Umbraco, refer to the [Installation article](../../fundamentals/setup/install/). On the installation wizard, follow the steps:

1.  Enter your **Name**, **Email**, and **Password**.

2. Click on **Change Database** if you wish to configure another database for your Umbraco installation.
3. Choose the level of **Consent for telemetry data** of your Umbraco installation.
4. Click **Install**.

The installation will take a couple of minutes to complete. Once the installation is complete, you will see the **Umbraco Backoffice** screen.

### Preparing the Custom Umbraco Template Site

1. Unzip the [Custom Umbraco Template](https://umbra.co/Umbracotemplate) to a folder on your system.
2.  Open the **index.html** from the folder in your preferred browser to see the template.

The template contains some text with dummy links. We’re going to turn this into a fully-fledged, Umbraco-powered site!

## Logging in to Umbraco

You can log in to Umbraco in two ways:

1. Once the installation is complete, you will see the **Login** screen. You can enter the **Name** and **Password** used during the installation process.
2. Run localhost in your browser to see the **Login** screen.
3.  Enter the **Name** and **Password** used during the installation process. You should see a similar Umbraco Backoffice as the image below:
