# Editing Existing Content

## Content Within the Tree View

When you are looking to edit content, locate the _**page**_ you want to edit in the section tree on the left-side of the screen.

4. Click **Save** to save the edits without publishing it.
5. Click **Save and preview** to preview the changes.
6. Click **Save and publish** to publish the changes. For more information, see the [Save and Publishing Pages](creating-saving-and-publishing-content.md#saving-and-publishing-pages) article.

## View Page Layout

You can view Page layouts in three ways:

1.  **Tree View**

    The tree view is present in the section tree on the left-side of the screen. For a growing website with multiple content pages, the tree view can become very large and unmanageable.

2.  **List View**

    When you enable listview on a page, there will be no standard tree view for that page. Clicking on the parent page displays the child pages in the list view.

    To enable list view:

    1. Go to **Settings**.
    2. Navigate to the Document Type/page you wish to enable list view.
    3. Go to the **List View** tab.
    4.  Toggle **Enable List view** and click **Save**.

    Additionally, you can sort the column **Name**, **Last edited**, and **Created by** in ascending or descending order to sort the list items.
3.  **Tiles View**

    You can switch between list view and tiles view by clicking the view icon in the top-right of the screen:
