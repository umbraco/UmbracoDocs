# Sorting Pages

The pages in Umbraco are placed in the tree structure according to a predefined sort order. The most recently created page is placed at the bottom of the tree structure. You can change the order of the pages by using the **Sort** function.

You can sort pages in two ways:

## Option 1

1. Go to **Content**.
2. Navigate to the parent node whose child nodes you wish to sort.
3.  Right-click the parent node and select **Sort**. Alternatively, click **•••** next to the parent node and select **Sort**.

4.  A window appears next to the section tree. Here, you can arrange the child nodes in the order you want by dragging them up or down. Alternatively, you can click the column headers to sort the entire collection of items in ascending or descending order.
