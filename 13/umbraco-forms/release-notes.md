## Release history

This section contains the release notes for Umbraco Forms 13 including all changes for this version.

### [13.6.0](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.Forms.Issues/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3Arelease%2F13.6.0) (August 28th 2025)

#### Add support for subscription licensing using product key

In addition to the existing one-off license using the `umbracoForms.lic` file, support for configuring a subscription license using a product key is added. As [announced](https://github.com/umbraco/Announcements/issues/25), Forms 17 will only be available through a subscription-based license. You can already purchase a new subscription (avoiding the one-off purchase) or convert your recently purchased one-off license into a subscription.

The 14-day trial license is no longer generated on install. You can still fully test Forms on `localhost`. The option to configure the license from the backoffice is removed. This is due to the direct integration with the legacy license infrastructure and to align the license management to the Licenses dashboard.

Read more about [the licensing model](./installation/the-licensing-model.md).

#### Only show reCAPTCHA v2 or v3 fields when settings are configured

Forms provides reCAPTCHA v2 and v3 fields out of the box, but both were always shown to editors in the backoffice. These fields are now only shown when their respective settings are configured. This avoids editors adding a reCAPTCHA field that doesn't work due to missing configuration and/or mixing up the v2 and v3 versions.

If the settings aren't configured in `appsettings.json` or environment variables (and thus available through `IConfiguration`), the required field needs to be manually added. This can be the case when manually configuring the `Recaptcha2Settings` or `Recaptcha3Settings` object in code:

```csharp
builder.Services.Configure<Recaptcha3Settings>(options =>
{
    options.SiteKey = "...";
    options.PrivateKey = "...";
});

// Ensure the field is added and available
builder.FormsFields().Add<Recaptcha3>();
```

#### Allow using ViewEngine to resolve theme views

The default theme views are resolved using the [Partial Views file system](../umbraco-cms/extending/filesystemproviders/README.md#other-ifilesystems) (an abstraction over the `/Views/Partials` directory). This requires I/O lookups to determine whether specific theme views exist and manually specifying all files when using a [Razor Class Library](./developer/themes.md#shipping-themes-in-a-razor-class-library).

By enabling the [`UseViewEngineFormThemeResolver` setting](./developer/configuration/README.md#useviewengineformthemeresolver), theme vies are resolved using the `ICompositeViewEngine`, which will include compiled views (including those shipped in RCLs).

### [13.5.0](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.Forms.Issues/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3Arelease%2F13.5.0) (June 12th 2025)

#### Validation rules across form fields

When creating forms you are able to add validation to individual fields, making them mandatory or applying a regular expression pattern. With the 13.4 release we are looking to make this more powerful, by allowing the addition of validation rules for the entire form. The idea is that this will allow you to validate expressions based on multiple fields. For example, "these two email fields should be the same", or "this date should be after this other one".

Crafting these rules requires use of [JSON logic](https://jsonlogic.com/) so is considered a "power user" feature. They also require an additional front-end dependency for the rendering of forms on the website. As such they are surfaced on a new "Advanced" tab and only visible and used if enabled in configuration. We don't have, and it seems difficult to provide, an intuitive user interface for rule creation taking into account all the flexibility available. Nonetheless, having the ability to use more complex validation rules seems a valuable addition.

When the form is rendered, the validation rules will be applied on the client, where we support both the `aspnet-client-validation` and `jquery.validate` libraries. They are also verified server-side. In this way you can ensure the submission is only accepted if it meets the requirements.

Feedback on this feature in particular is welcome.

Read more about [editing advanced validation rules](./editor/creating-a-form/form-advanced.md) as well as the [configuration option required to enable them](./developer/configuration/README.md#enableadvancedvalidationrules).

#### Tracking editor activity

Whilst previously we tracked and displayed the date a form was created and last edited, we didn't show who had made these updates. With 13.4 installed we will start to track this and display the information where available. You'll find this on the form, data source or prevalue source's "Info" tab [#1315](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.Forms.Issues/issues/1315).

#### Copy of workflows

Forms allows you to make a copy of a form to use as a starting point for a new one. You can choose whether or not to copy workflows along with the form. With the 13.4 release, we've made available a second dialog allowing you to copy workflows to an existing form [#1185](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.Forms.Issues/issues/1185). You can select any or all of the workflows on the current form and copy them to the selected destination form.

We've also resolved an edge case around copying a form. It's possible to [define workflows as mandatory](./developer/extending/customize-default-workflows.md#setting-a-mandatory-default-workflow). Copying the form without workflows excludes the desired workflow. You would have a form that didn't contain the workflow you wanted to be included on all. This has been tightened up now and mandatory workflows will always be assigned to the copied form [#1331](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.Forms.Issues/issues/1331).

#### File upload validation messages

Previously the validation messages presented on the website front end when uploading files were hardcoded and always provided in English. We've added settings now to the "File Upload" field type allowing you to customize these. Dictionary keys can be used in order to provide the information in the user's preferred language [#1327](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.Forms.Issues/issues/1327).

### [13.3.3](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.Forms.Issues/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3Arelease%2F13.3.3) (December 5th 2024)

* Fixed regression introduced in 13.3.1 that caused issues for custom field types overriding the `ProcessSubmittedValue` method  [#1328](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.Forms.Issues/issues/1328).

### [13.3.2](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.Forms.Issues/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3Arelease%2F13.3.2) (November 28th 2024)

* Fixed issue with case sensitive checkbox conditions across multi-page forms [#1325](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.Forms.Issues/issues/1325).

### [13.3.1](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.Forms.Issues/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3Arelease%2F13.3.1) (November 21st 2024)

* Fixed issues with multi-page forms used in conjunction with a `FormPrePopulateNotification` handler. File uploads and multi-value fields like checkbox lists now function correctly [#1317](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.Forms.Issues/issues/1317) [#1320](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.Forms.Issues/issues/1320).
* Added a couple of missing translation keys [#1316](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.Forms.Issues/issues/1316) [#1319](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.Forms.Issues/issues/1319).
* Improved accessibility and styling of close button on export dialog [#1321](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.Forms.Issues/issues/1321).

* All items detailed under release candidates for 13.3.0.
* Fixed issue with validation for invalid file extension on form submissions via the API [#1310](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.Forms.Issues/issues/1310).

### [13.3.0-rc1](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.Forms.Issues/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3Arelease%2F13.3.0) (October 25th 2024)

#### Multi-step forms

The 13.3 release of Forms contains features that can improve the user experience of completing multi-page forms.

We have added the option for [editors to choose to display paging details on the forms](./editor/creating-a-form/form-settings.md#multi-page-forms). This will allow those completing forms to get a better understanding of progress as well as see details of the pages still to be completed. [#281](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.Forms.Issues/issues/281) [#648](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.Forms.Issues/issues/648).

These options are enabled and configured by editors in the Forms settings section on a per-form basis. We also provide a [configuration-based toggle for the feature as a whole](./developer/configuration/README.md#enablemultipageformsettings). In this way, editors can be given access to use the feature only once the styling or theme is prepared.

#### Ship themes in Razor Class Libraries

Forms ships it's themes and email templates as part of a razor class library for ease of distribution. With this release we make that feature [available to your own custom themes and templates](./developer/themes.md#shipping-themes-in-a-razor-class-library) (or those created by package developers) [#795](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.Forms.Issues/issues/795).

#### Date picker field type

We have made a couple of updates to the Date Picker field type. The format for the field can now be provided in configuration [#1276](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.Forms.Issues/issues/1276). And you can now override and localize the aria-label provided for assistive technologies such as screen readers [#1082](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.Forms.Issues/issues/1082).

#### Finer grained entries permissions

To allow finer control over editor permissions, we have introduced a "delete entries" setting for users and user groups. Thus you can now give editors explicit permissions to view, edit, or delete entries [#1303](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.Forms.Issues/issues/1303).

#### Other

Other bug fixes included in the release:

* Fixed issue with single checkbox triggering a condition on a field on a subsequent page [#1304](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.Forms.Issues/issues/1304).
* Improved cross-platform check when exporting to Excel.

With the introduction of webhooks in Umbraco 13, we've made an update to Forms to allow workflow execution events to trigger webhooks. Workflows are operations that you can associate with form submission, approval, or rejection actions. You can use these where you need to notify external systems of the success or failure of a workflow. Read more on [Umbraco Forms Webhooks](./developer/webhooks.md).

We've added an update that will help customers using Forms within locked down production environments.

And there are a couple of further additions to improve the performance and accessibility of the product.

#### Features implemented and issues resolved in 13.1.0
