## Release History

This section contains the release notes for Umbraco Workflow 13 including all changes for this version.

### 13.4.5 (https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.Workflow.Issues/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3Arelease%2F13.4.5) (July 30 2025)

* Fixes a bug where group permissions were not reset when removing a group from a Document Type approval flow.

* Fixes a bug where the document path was incorrectly set as a number array instead of a comma-delimited string. In certain scenarios this caused a validation error when attempting to save a new document, leaving the document uneditable.

### [13.3.1](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.Workflow.Issues/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3Arelease%2F13.3.1) (January 16 2025 )

* Adds support for content segments. Segment names are displayed when requesting approval and in workflow history [#60](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.Workflow.Issues/issues/60)
* Adds support for Arabic.
* Improves UI in workflow detail overlay. Reduces the number of elements and shifts appropriate data points into tag elements.

* **BREAKING CHANGE** resolving [#77](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.Workflow.Issues/issues/77) includes removing the `DateTimeSettings` class. This class allowed setting the preferred format for dates in the Backoffice. These settings were never applied, or were ignored when localising dates. Corresponding settings in app settings should be removed.
