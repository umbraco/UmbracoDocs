# Workflow History

The Umbraco Workflow History provides a chronological audit trail of workflow activity for all the nodes.

It displays a table containing the following details:

* Page name/Node with the Language variant.
* Type of Publish.
* Editor/Original author requesting the workflow.
* Date the workflow was requested on.
* Comment describing the changes.
* Status of the workflow.

You can also **Filter** the records based on the Node, Requested by, Created date, Completed date, Page Language, Workflow Type, and Workflow Status.

Additionally, you can adjust the total number of records displayed on a page.

The **Detail** button at the end of the record displays an overlay with content similar to the [Active workflow](active-workflows.md) sub-section.
