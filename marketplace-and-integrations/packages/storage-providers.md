# Storage Providers

`Umbraco.StorageProviders` and `Umbraco.StorageProviders.AzureBlob` are open-source packages supported by Umbraco that allow you to replace the default physical file storage for an alternative. An implementation that uses [Azure Blob Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/storage/blobs) for media and image caching is provided.

For details on usage, to review, or contribute to the code, see the [Umbraco.StorageProviders repository at GitHub](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.StorageProviders).
