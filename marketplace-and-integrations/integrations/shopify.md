# Shopify Integration

This integration provides a products picker and a value converter that creates a strongly typed model for rendering. Products can be retrieved from a [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/) store or through custom apps developed by [Shopify Partners](https://www.shopify.com/partners).

## Package Links

- [NuGet install](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Umbraco.Cms.Integrations.Commerce.Shopify)
- [Source code](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.Cms.Integrations/tree/main/src/Umbraco.Cms.Integrations.Commerce.Shopify)
- [Umbraco marketplace listing](https://marketplace.umbraco.com/package/umbraco.cms.integrations.commerce.shopify)

## Prerequisites

Required minimum versions of Umbraco CMS:

- Version 8: 8.5.4
- Version 9+: 9.0.1

## Authentication

The package supports two modes of authentication:

- API Access Token
- OAuth

### API Access Token

Follow these steps to retrieve an API Access token:

1. Log into the admin interface of your shop by accessing `https://{shop}.myshopify.com/admin`.
2. Go to **Apps > Develop apps**.
3. Create a new App for the shop.
4. Enable the App Development feature if it is currently disabled.
5. Define the scopes for the Admin API: _read_products_.
6. Select the option to **Install App**.

Once the app is installed the Admin API access token will be visible **only once** in the _API credentials_ tab.

Use the access token and add it to an app setting in `Web.config` alongside settings for the API version and the name of the shop:

```xml
  <appSettings>
    <add key="Umbraco.Cms.Integrations.Commerce.Shopify.ApiVersion" value="2022-01" />
    <add key="Umbraco.Cms.Integrations.Commerce.Shopify.AccessToken" value="[your access token]" />
    <add key="Umbraco.Cms.Integrations.Commerce.Shopify.Shop" value="[your shop's name]" />
  </appSettings>
```

Shopify releases a new API version every 3 months at the beginning of the quarter. The latest stable version used for this integration is [2022-01](https://shopify.dev/api/usage/versioning).

### OAuth

If you prefer not to use an API token, an authentication flow using OAuth is also available.

To use this, ensure you do not have an API key in your configuration file.

## Backoffice usage

To use the products picker, a new Data Type should be created based on the Shopify Products Picker property editor.

The settings in `Web.config` will be checked and a message presented indicating whether authentication is in place.

If OAuth is being used for authentication, then the _Connect_ button will be enabled. When clicked, the user will be prompted with the Shopify authorization window.

The retrieved access token will be saved into the database and used for future requests.

The _Revoke_ action will remove the access token from the database and the authorization process will need to be repeated.

## Front-end rendering

A [strongly typed model](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.Cms.Integrations/blob/main/src/Umbraco.Cms.Integrations.Commerce.Shopify/Models/ViewModels/ProductViewModel.cs) will be generated by the property value converter. An HTML helper is available, to render the products on the front-end.

Ensure your template has a reference to the following using statement:

```csharp
@using Umbraco.Cms.Integrations.Commerce.Shopify.Helpers;
```

Assuming a property based on the created Data Type, with alias `shopifyProductPicker` has been created, render the form using:

```csharp
@Html.RenderProductsList(Model.ShopifyProductPicker)
```

You can use the default rendering view and style using the existing CSS classes, or use it as inspiration for your own views. The path to your custom view will be then passed as parameter to the HTML helper method.
