By default the list is filtered to show only entries from the past month. If you want to change this simply update the filter settings.

You can also filter the entries by specific words by using the search field to the left.

## Exporting data

You can export all of the entries from your form, by clicking the *Export* button in the top-right, to open the Export overlay.

Then in the overlay simply select the format of the export

The options are

- Excel File
- Save all Uploaded Files (only visible if you have a *File Upload* field in the form)

## Record actions

When selecting entries it's possible to execute actions. To select an entry, simply click anywhere on the entry. Note that clicking the first value - *Name* in the example below - will open a view, where you can see the entire entry.
