# Workflow History

The Workflow History provides a chronological audit trail of workflow activity for all the nodes. It displays a table containing the Page name/Node with the Language variant, Type of Publish, workflow requested by, date the workflow was requested on, comment describing the changes, and status of the workflow.

You can also **Filter** the records based on the Node, Requested by, Created date, Completed date, Page Language, Workflow Type, and Workflow Status.

The **Detail** button at the end of the record displays an overlay with content similar to the Active workflow sub-section.
